Given the constraints and goals provided, let's develop an optimal plan to paint the tiles as described using the two robots starting from the bottom row. Since the robots can only paint in the direction they are facing (up or down) and cannot move onto a painted tile, we must carefully plan their movements and actions.

Initial Setup:
Grid: 5 rows Ã— 3 columns, all tiles initially unpainted.
Robots: Robot1 starts at tile 4-1, Robot2 starts at tile 4-3.
Colors: Both robots can switch between white and black.
Goal:
Paint the grid in the specified pattern:

Row 1: White, Black, White
Row 2: Black, White, Black
Row 3: White, Black, White
Row 4: Black, White, Black
Plan:
Steps for Robot1:
Start at tile 4-1 (currently unpainted, initial position).
Paint tile 4-1 black.
Move up to tile 3-1.
Paint tile 3-1 white.
Move up to tile 2-1.
Paint tile 2-1 black.
Move up to tile 1-1.
Paint tile 1-1 white.
Steps for Robot2:
Start at tile 4-3 (currently unpainted, initial position).
Paint tile 4-3 black.
Move up to tile 3-3.
Paint tile 3-3 white.
Move up to tile 2-3.
Paint tile 2-3 black.
Move up to tile 1-3.
Paint tile 1-3 white.
Coordinated Actions:
Since the center column (tiles x-2 for each row) needs alternating colors and no robot starts there, we need to use one robot to handle this after finishing the edges:

After Robot1 finishes tile 1-1:
Move right to tile 1-2.
Paint tile 1-2 black.
Move down to tile 2-2.
Paint tile 2-2 white.
Move down to tile 3-2.
Paint tile 3-2 black.
Move down to tile 4-2.
Paint tile 4-2 white.
Final Movement:
Both robots will finish their sequence without needing further movements as they cannot move over painted tiles, and all tasks are completed in their designated paths.

Conclusion:
This plan ensures minimal movements and efficient use of the robots' ability to paint only forward or backward relative to their facing direction. Each robot primarily covers one side of the grid vertically and then one robot handles the central column. The constraints of no standing on painted tiles and painting only available directions are adhered to. This sequence should successfully achieve the painting pattern desired with optimal robot utility.
