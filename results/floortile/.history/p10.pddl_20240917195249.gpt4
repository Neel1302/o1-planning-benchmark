Given the problem constraints and the positions of the robots, let's devise a plan that utilizes each robot efficiently to paint the specified pattern without stepping on painted tiles.

Initial Setup:
Grid: 6 rows Ã— 4 columns, all tiles initially unpainted.
Robots:
Robot1 starts at tile 1-3.
Robot2 starts at tile 1-1.
Colors: Both robots can switch between white and black.
Goal:
Paint the grid in the specified pattern for each row:

Row 1: White, Black, White, Black
Row 2: Black, White, Black, White
Row 3: White, Black, White, Black
Row 4: Black, White, Black, White
Row 5: White, Black, White, Black
Plan:
Steps for Robot1 (starting at tile 1-3):
Paint tile 1-3 white.
Move right to tile 1-4.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-4 black.
Move down to tile 2-4.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 2-4 white.
Move left to tile 2-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-3 black.
Move left to tile 2-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 2-2 white.
Move left to tile 2-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-1 black.
Move down to tile 3-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-1 white.
Move right to tile 3-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 3-2 black.
Move right to tile 3-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-3 white.
Move right to tile 3-4.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 3-4 black.
Steps for Robot2 (starting at tile 1-1):
Paint tile 1-1 white.
Move right to tile 1-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-2 black.
Move down to tile 2-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 2-2 white (already done by Robot1, skip if necessary).
Move down to tile 3-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 3-2 black (already done by Robot1, skip if necessary).
Move down to tile 4-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 4-2 white.
Move left to tile 4-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-1 black.
Move right twice to tile 4-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-3 black.
Move right to tile 4-4.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 4-4 white.
Move down to tile 5-4.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 5-4 black.
Move left to tile 5-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 5-3 white.
Move left to tile 5-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 5-2 black.
Move left to tile 5-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 5-1 white.
Strategic Notes:
Robot1 handles one side of the grid systematically, painting from right to left as it moves down.
Robot2 starts on the other side and mirrors Robot1's actions, ensuring all tiles on its side are painted accordingly.
The plan maximizes the efficiency of each robot, limiting backtracking and avoiding any violations of the constraints regarding painted tiles.
This plan should effectively accomplish the painting task with each robot executing their roles efficiently while adhering to the movement and painting restrictions.
