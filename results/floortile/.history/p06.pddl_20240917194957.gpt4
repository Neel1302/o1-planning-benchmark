For the given planning problem with two robots and a specific painting pattern, we must strategize the movements and actions of each robot to ensure they can paint the grid without violating any restrictions. Below is an optimal step-by-step plan, assuming robots can only paint the tile directly in front or behind them, cannot move onto painted tiles, and must switch colors to match the required tile color.

Initial Setup:
Grid: 5 rows Ã— 4 columns, all tiles initially unpainted.
Robots:
Robot1 starts at tile 1-1.
Robot2 starts at tile 0-3.
Goal:
To paint the grid in the specified pattern:

Row 1: White, Black, White, Black
Row 2: Black, White, Black, White
Row 3: White, Black, White, Black
Row 4: Black, White, Black, White
Row 5: Black, White, Black, White
Plan:
Steps for Robot1 (starting at tile 1-1):
Paint tile 1-1 white.
Move right to tile 1-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-2 black.
Move right to tile 1-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 1-3 white.
Move right to tile 1-4.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-4 black.
Move down to tile 2-4.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 2-4 white.
Move left to tile 2-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-3 black.
Move left to tile 2-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 2-2 white.
Move left to tile 2-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-1 black.
Steps for Robot2 (starting at tile 0-3):
Move down to tile 1-3.
Change color to white (if needed, based on current color).
Move down to tile 2-3.
Move down to tile 3-3.
Paint tile 3-3 white.
Move right to tile 3-4.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 3-4 black.
Move left twice to tile 3-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-2 white.
Move left to tile 3-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 3-1 black.
Move down to tile 4-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-1 black.
Move right to tile 4-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 4-2 white.
Move right to tile 4-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-3 black.
Move right to tile 4-4.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 4-4 white.
Strategic Notes:
Robot1 efficiently handles painting the first and second rows in sequence, working systematically from left to right and then right to left.
Robot2 begins by moving into position without painting, then covers rows 3 and 4, and finally row 5, again working systematically to minimize movements and ensure compliance with the restrictions.
Each robot operates in a designated area to avoid crossing paths or entering already painted tiles.
This plan ensures each robot contributes effectively to achieving the painting pattern, adhering to movement restrictions and maximizing efficiency by minimizing unnecessary actions.
