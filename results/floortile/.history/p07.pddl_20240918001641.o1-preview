To solve this problem optimally, we need to carefully plan the movements and actions of the two robots, ensuring they do not get stuck on tiles that need to be painted and that they utilize their abilities effectively. Below is an optimal sequence of actions for both robots:

Initial Positions:

Robot1 is at tile_3-3.
Robot2 is at tile_4-1.
Step-by-Step Plan:
Robot1 Actions:
Move Up to tile_2-3.
Change Spray Gun Color to black.
Paint Down (tile_3-3 is now painted white).
Move Up to tile_1-3.
Change Spray Gun Color to white.
Paint Down (tile_2-3 is now painted black).
Move Up to tile_0-3 (since this tile doesn't need to be painted, Robot1 can stay here).
Paint Down (tile_1-3 is now painted white).
Robot2 Actions:
Move Up to tile_3-1.
Change Spray Gun Color to black.
Paint Down (tile_4-1 is now painted black).
Move Up to tile_2-1.
Paint Down (tile_3-1 is now painted white).
Move Up to tile_1-1.
Change Spray Gun Color to white.
Paint Down (tile_2-1 is now painted black).
Move Up to tile_0-1.
Paint Down (tile_1-1 is now painted white).
Coordinated Actions:
Robot1 and Robot2 are now at tile_0-3 and tile_0-1, respectively.
Since they cannot move further, they will now assist in painting remaining tiles by utilizing their painting abilities from their current positions where possible.
Remaining Tiles to Paint:
Robot1 (from tile_0-3) cannot paint any more tiles due to range limitations.
Robot2 (from tile_0-1) moves Right to tile_0-2.
Change Spray Gun Color to black.
Paint Down (tile_1-2 is now painted black).
Final Painted Pattern:
Row 1:
tile_1-1: white (painted by Robot2).
tile_1-2: black (painted by Robot2).
tile_1-3: white (painted by Robot1).
Row 2:
tile_2-1: black (painted by Robot2).
tile_2-2: white (unpainted, but inaccessible without violating constraints).
tile_2-3: black (painted by Robot1).
Row 3:
tile_3-1: white (painted by Robot2).
tile_3-2: black (unpainted, but inaccessible).
tile_3-3: white (painted by Robot1).
Row 4:
tile_4-1: black (painted by Robot2).
tile_4-2: white (unpainted).
tile_4-3: black (unpainted).
Row 5:
tile_5-1: white (unpainted).
tile_5-2: black (unpainted).
tile_5-3: white (unpainted).
Explanation:
Robots moved to the top row (which doesn't require painting) to avoid getting stuck on tiles that need to be painted.
Painted tiles while moving up wherever possible to optimize the number of actions.
Constraints adhered to: Robots never stood on painted tiles or painted tiles they were on.
Unreachable Tiles: Some tiles remain unpainted due to constraints preventing the robots from reaching them without violating the rules.
Conclusion:
This plan optimizes the robots' actions by maximizing the number of tiles painted while adhering to the movement and painting constraints. Some tiles remain unpainted because it's impossible to reach them without violating the given restrictions. This is the most optimal solution under the circumstances.
