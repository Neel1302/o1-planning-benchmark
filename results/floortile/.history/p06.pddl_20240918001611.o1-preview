Certainly! I'll provide an optimal plan for the two robots to paint the grid according to the specified pattern while adhering to all the given constraints.

Grid Layout:
We have a grid of 5 rows (0 to 4) and 4 columns (1 to 4):

Copy code
tile_0-1  tile_0-2  tile_0-3  tile_0-4
tile_1-1  tile_1-2  tile_1-3  tile_1-4
tile_2-1  tile_2-2  tile_2-3  tile_2-4
tile_3-1  tile_3-2  tile_3-3  tile_3-4
tile_4-1  tile_4-2  tile_4-3  tile_4-4
Goal Pattern:
White Tiles:
tile_1-1, tile_1-3, tile_2-2, tile_2-4, tile_3-1, tile_3-3, tile_4-2, tile_4-4
Black Tiles:
tile_1-2, tile_1-4, tile_2-1, tile_2-3, tile_3-2, tile_3-4, tile_4-1, tile_4-3
Robots' Starting Positions:
Robot1: tile_1-1
Robot2: tile_0-3
Optimal Plan:
We will assign each robot specific areas to maximize efficiency and avoid conflicts.

Robot1 will handle columns 1 and 2.
Robot2 will handle columns 3 and 4.
Robot1's Actions:
Objective: Paint necessary tiles in columns 1 and 2.

From tile_1-1, move down to tile_2-1.
Change spray gun color to Black.
Paint Up: Paint tile_1-1 White (from tile_2-1).
Note: Since tile_1-1 needs to be White, we need to change the spray gun color to White.
Adjust Action:
Change spray gun color to White.
Paint Up: Paint tile_1-1 White.
Paint Down: Paint tile_3-1 White (from tile_2-1).
Move Right to tile_2-2.
Change spray gun color to White.
Paint Up: Paint tile_1-2 White.
Note: tile_1-2 needs to be Black.
Adjust Action:
Change spray gun color to Black.
Paint Up: Paint tile_1-2 Black.
Paint Down: Paint tile_3-2 Black (from tile_2-2).
Robot1 is at tile_2-2, which needs to be White.
Robot1 cannot paint the tile it's on.
Move Left back to tile_2-1.
Move Down to tile_3-1 (cannot move onto painted tile).
Move Up to tile_1-1 (cannot move onto painted tile).
Robot1 is unable to proceed further without violating constraints.
Robot2's Actions:
Objective: Paint necessary tiles in columns 3 and 4.

From tile_0-3, change spray gun color to White.
Paint Down: Paint tile_1-3 White.
Move Right to tile_0-4.
Change spray gun color to Black.
Paint Down: Paint tile_1-4 Black.
Move Down to tile_1-4 (cannot move onto painted tile).
Move Left back to tile_0-3.
Move Down to tile_1-3 (cannot move onto painted tile).
From tile_0-3, move Down is blocked.
Move Left to tile_0-2.
Change spray gun color to Black.
Paint Down: Paint tile_1-2 Black (already painted by Robot1).
Note: Cannot repaint; move to next action.
Move Left to tile_0-1.
Move Down to tile_1-1 (cannot move onto painted tile).
Robot2 cannot proceed further without violating constraints.
Robot1's Additional Actions:
Since Robot1 is at tile_2-2 and cannot paint tile_2-2 (the tile it's on), we need to find a way to paint it.

Move Down to tile_3-2.
Cannot move onto painted tile (tile_3-2 is painted Black).
Move Up to tile_1-2.
Cannot move onto painted tile (tile_1-2 is painted Black).
Robot1 is unable to proceed further.
Robot2's Additional Actions:
From tile_0-1, move Right to tile_0-2.
Move Down to tile_1-2 (cannot move onto painted tile).
Robot2 is unable to proceed further.
Challenges and Constraints:
Robots cannot paint the tile they are on, preventing them from painting tile_2-2 (White) and tile_2-1 (Black) from their current positions.
Robots cannot move onto painted tiles, restricting their movement after painting adjacent tiles.
Access to lower rows is blocked due to painted tiles or boundary limits.
Alternative Plan to Complete the Goal:
To fully achieve the goal pattern, we need to adjust our strategy.

Robot1's Revised Actions:
From tile_1-1, move down to tile_2-1.
Change spray gun color to Black.
Paint Up: Paint tile_1-1 White (from tile_2-1).
Adjust Action:
Change spray gun color to White.
Paint Up: Paint tile_1-1 White.
Paint Down: Paint tile_3-1 White (from tile_2-1).
Move Right to tile_2-2.
Change spray gun color to White.
Paint the tile under (cannot paint the tile the robot is on).
Adjust Strategy: Since tile_2-2 needs to be White and we cannot paint it from this position, we need to find another way.
Move Down to tile_3-2.
Change spray gun color to Black.
Paint Up: Paint tile_2-2 White (from tile_3-2).
Note: We need to paint tile_2-2 White, so we should change the spray gun color to White.
Adjust Action:
Change spray gun color to White.
Paint Up: Paint tile_2-2 White.
Paint Down: Paint tile_4-2 White (from tile_3-2).
Robot1 is at tile_3-2.
Robot2's Revised Actions:
From tile_0-3, change spray gun color to White.
Paint Down: Paint tile_1-3 White.
Move Down to tile_1-3.
Move Down to tile_2-3.
Change spray gun color to Black.
Paint Up: Paint tile_1-3 White (already painted).
Paint Down: Paint tile_3-3 White.
Move Down to tile_3-3.
Move Down to tile_4-3.
Change spray gun color to Black.
Paint Up: Paint tile_3-3 White (already painted).
Paint Down: Paint tile_5-3 (out of bounds).
Adjust Action: Since we cannot paint beyond the grid, skip this step.
Robot2 is at tile_4-3, which needs to be Black.
Cannot paint the tile it's on.
Move Left to tile_4-2 (occupied by painted tile).
Cannot move onto painted tile (tile_4-2 is painted White by Robot1).
Robot2 is unable to proceed further.
Completing Remaining Tiles:
Given the robots' positions and the constraints, some tiles remain unpainted or need to be painted from different positions.

Tiles Remaining:
Black Tiles:
tile_2-1 (Robot1 is adjacent at tile_2-1).
White Tiles:
tile_4-4 (accessible by Robot2).
Robot1's Additional Actions:
From tile_3-2, move Left to tile_3-1.
Change spray gun color to White.
Paint Down: Paint tile_4-1 Black (from tile_3-1).
Note: tile_4-1 needs to be Black, so change spray gun color to Black.
Adjust Action:
Change spray gun color to Black.
Paint Down: Paint tile_4-1 Black.
Paint Up: Paint tile_2-1 Black (from tile_3-1).
Robot1 is at tile_3-1.
Robot2's Additional Actions:
From tile_4-3, move Right to tile_4-4.
Change spray gun color to White.
Paint Up: Paint tile_3-4 Black (from tile_4-4).
Note: tile_3-4 needs to be Black, so change spray gun color to Black.
Adjust Action:
Change spray gun color to Black.
Paint Up: Paint tile_3-4 Black.
Paint Down: Paint tile_5-4 (out of bounds).
Skip this step.
Robot2 is at tile_4-4, which needs to be White.
Cannot paint the tile it's on.
Final Painted Tiles:
White Tiles:
tile_1-1 (Robot1)
tile_2-2 (Robot1)
tile_3-1 (Robot1)
tile_4-2 (Robot1)
tile_1-3 (Robot2)
tile_3-3 (Robot2)
Black Tiles:
tile_1-2 (Robot1)
tile_2-1 (Robot1)
tile_3-2 (Robot1)
tile_4-1 (Robot1)
tile_3-4 (Robot2)
Unpainted Tiles:
tile_2-3, tile_2-4, tile_4-3, tile_4-4
Conclusion:
Despite our best efforts, due to the constraints and the robots' inability to:

Paint the tile they are on.
Move onto painted tiles.
Access certain tiles without violating constraints.
It is not possible to fully achieve the goal pattern under the current rules and starting positions. The plan provided paints as many tiles as possible according to the goal pattern while adhering to all the given constraints.
