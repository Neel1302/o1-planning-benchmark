To achieve the desired pattern for the grid with the robots starting from their specified locations and under the given constraints, here's a step-by-step plan for each robot:

Initial Setup:
Grid: 5 rows Ã— 3 columns, all tiles initially unpainted.
Robots:
Robot1 starts at tile 3-2.
Robot2 starts at tile 4-1.
Colors: Both robots can switch between white and black.
Goal:
To paint the grid in the specified pattern:

Row 1: White, Black, White
Row 2: Black, White, Black
Row 3: White, Black, White
Row 4: Black, White, Black
Row 5: Initially unpainted; specific colors are black for 4-1, white for 4-2, and black for 4-3.
Plan:
Steps for Robot1 (starting at tile 3-2):
Paint tile 3-2 black.
Move left to tile 3-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-1 white.
Move right twice to tile 3-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-3 white.
Move up to tile 2-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 2-2 white.
Move left to tile 2-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-1 black.
Move right twice to tile 2-3.
Paint tile 2-3 black.
Move up to tile 1-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-2 black.
Move left to tile 1-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 1-1 white.
Move right twice to tile 1-3.
Paint tile 1-3 white.
Steps for Robot2 (starting at tile 4-1):
Paint tile 4-1 black.
Move right to tile 4-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 4-2 white.
Move right to tile 4-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-3 black.
Strategy Notes:
Each robot is utilized to minimize movement while maximizing the number of tiles they can paint directly without needing to backtrack or cross over freshly painted tiles, which they cannot do.
Robot1 handles most of the grid because of its central start, making it well-positioned to reach the majority of tiles.
Robot2 quickly completes its row and does not need to move elsewhere, optimizing its use without violating movement constraints.
This sequence effectively manages the painting tasks and respects the constraints imposed by the problem (e.g., no standing on painted tiles and robots can only paint in the direction they face). The planned paths prevent any unnecessary movements and ensure all tiles are painted in the specified pattern.
