To optimally achieve the specified painting pattern in a grid with two robots, starting at designated positions, and with the constraints given (each robot can only paint tiles directly in front or behind them, and cannot move onto already painted tiles), here’s a detailed action plan:

Initial Setup:
Grid: 6 rows × 3 columns, all tiles initially unpainted.
Robots:
Robot1 starts at tile 3-3.
Robot2 starts at tile 4-1.
Colors: Both robots can switch between white and black.
Goal:
To paint the grid in the specified pattern:

Row 1: White, Black, White
Row 2: Black, White, Black
Row 3: White, Black, White
Row 4: Black, White, Black
Row 5: White, Black, White
Row 6: Unspecified, but assuming the continuation of the pattern: Black, White, Black (using the pattern, though no instructions are given for this row in the prompt)
Plan:
Steps for Robot1 (starting at tile 3-3):
Paint tile 3-3 white.
Move left to tile 3-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 3-2 black.
Move left to tile 3-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-1 white.
Move up to tile 2-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-1 black.
Move right to tile 2-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 2-2 white.
Move right to tile 2-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-3 black.
Move up to tile 1-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 1-3 white.
Move left to tile 1-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-2 black.
Move left to tile 1-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 1-1 white.
Steps for Robot2 (starting at tile 4-1):
Paint tile 4-1 black.
Move right to tile 4-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 4-2 white.
Move right to tile 4-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-3 black.
Move down to tile 5-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 5-3 white.
Move left to tile 5-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 5-2 black.
Move left to tile 5-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 5-1 white.
Strategic Notes:
Robot1 starts by completing row 3, then works systematically upwards, completing rows 2 and 1.
Robot2 starts in the middle of row 4 and works systematically right, then proceeds to row 5, covering it completely.
Each robot operates efficiently in designated areas to avoid crossing paths or entering already painted tiles.
This methodical sequence ensures each robot contributes effectively to achieving the painting pattern, adhering to movement restrictions and maximizing efficiency. This plan should successfully achieve the painting pattern desired with optimal robot utility.
