Sure, I'll provide an optimal plan for the robots to paint the tiles according to the specified pattern while adhering to all the given constraints.

Grid Layout:

The grid is 5 rows (0 to 4) and 3 columns (1 to 3):

Copy code
tile_0-1  tile_0-2  tile_0-3
tile_1-1  tile_1-2  tile_1-3
tile_2-1  tile_2-2  tile_2-3
tile_3-1  tile_3-2  tile_3-3
tile_4-1  tile_4-2  tile_4-3
Goal Pattern:

White Tiles: tile_1-1, tile_1-3, tile_2-2, tile_3-1, tile_3-3, tile_4-2
Black Tiles: tile_1-2, tile_2-1, tile_2-3, tile_3-2, tile_4-1, tile_4-3
Robots' Starting Positions:

Robot1: tile_3-2
Robot2: tile_4-1
Robot1's Actions:
Objective: Paint tiles in columns 2 and 3.

Move Up to tile_2-2.
Change Spray Gun Color to Black.
Paint Down: Paint tile_3-2 Black (from tile_2-2).
Paint Up: Paint tile_1-2 Black (from tile_2-2).
Move Right to tile_2-3.
Change Spray Gun Color to Black (already black, but ensuring correct color).
Paint Down: Paint tile_3-3 Black (from tile_2-3).
Paint Up: Paint tile_1-3 Black (from tile_2-3).
Note: This conflicts with the goal pattern (these tiles should be White). Therefore, we need to adjust the plan.
Adjusted Robot1 Actions:

Change Spray Gun Color to White.
Paint Down: Paint tile_3-3 White (from tile_2-3).
Paint Up: Paint tile_1-3 White (from tile_2-3).
Move Left back to tile_2-2.
Change Spray Gun Color to White.
Paint Tile Underneath: Cannot paint tile_2-2 (since robots can't paint the tile they are on).
Move Down to tile_3-2 (already painted, cannot move there).
Issue: Robot1 is stuck on tile_2-2 and cannot paint tile_2-2 White.
Solution for Painting tile_2-2:

Robot2 will assist in painting tile_2-2.
Robot2's Actions:
Objective: Paint tiles in columns 1 and assist with tile_2-2.

Move Up to tile_3-1.
Change Spray Gun Color to Black.
Paint Down: Paint tile_4-1 Black (from tile_3-1).
Paint Up: Paint tile_2-1 Black (from tile_3-1).
Move Right to tile_3-2 (cannot, tile_3-2 is painted).
Move Up to tile_2-1.
Move Right to tile_2-2 (where Robot1 is currently located).
Issue: Cannot move onto tile_2-2 if occupied by Robot1.
Adjusted Robot1 Actions to Free tile_2-2:

Move Up to tile_1-2 (already painted Black, cannot move there).
Alternate Plan for Robot1:

Move Left to tile_2-1 (unpainted).

Change Spray Gun Color to White.

Paint Up: Paint tile_1-1 White (from tile_2-1).

Paint Down: Paint tile_3-1 White (from tile_2-1).

Now, tile_2-1 needs to be painted Black, but Robot1 is on it.
Move Right back to tile_2-2.

Now, tile_2-1 is free to be painted.
Robot2 Continues:

Move Up to tile_1-1.
Change Spray Gun Color to Black.
Paint Down: Paint tile_2-1 Black (from tile_1-1).
Move Right to tile_1-2 (painted Black, cannot move there).
Move Down to tile_2-1 (painted Black, cannot move there).
Robot2 is now at tile_1-1 (painted White, which is acceptable).
Robot1's Final Actions:

Now at tile_2-2, Robot1 cannot paint the tile underneath.
Move Down to tile_3-2 (painted Black, cannot move there).
Robot1 is stuck at tile_2-2.
Solution for Painting tile_2-2:

Robot2 can attempt to paint tile_2-2 from an adjacent tile.
Robot2's Actions:

Move Right to tile_1-2 (painted Black, cannot move there).
Move Down to tile_2-1 (painted Black, cannot move there).
Move Down to tile_3-1 (painted White, cannot move there).
Robot2 cannot reach a position to paint tile_2-2.
Alternative Plan for Robot1:

From tile_2-2, Robot1 moves Right to tile_2-3 (already occupied earlier).

Since tile_2-3 is unoccupied and unpainted, Robot1 can move there.
Robot1 now at tile_2-3, cannot paint tile_2-2 from here.

Robot1 is effectively stuck.

Final Solution:

Given the constraints, it's impossible for the robots to paint all tiles without violating the rules or getting stuck on unpainted tiles that need to be painted. However, we can maximize the number of tiles painted correctly.

Summary of Actions:
Robot1:

Move Up to tile_2-2.
Change Spray Gun Color to Black.
Paint Down: tile_3-2 Black.
Paint Up: tile_1-2 Black.
Move Left to tile_2-1.
Change Spray Gun Color to White.
Paint Up: tile_1-1 White.
Paint Down: tile_3-1 White.
Move Right to tile_2-2.
Robot1 is stuck on tile_2-2.
Robot2:

Move Up to tile_3-1.
Change Spray Gun Color to Black.
Paint Down: tile_4-1 Black.
Paint Up: tile_2-1 Black.
Move Up to tile_2-1 (painted, cannot move).
Robot2 is stuck on tile_3-1.
Unpainted Tiles Remaining:

tile_2-2 (Robot1 is on it, needs to be painted White).
tile_4-2 (unpainted, needs to be painted White).
tile_4-3 (unpainted, needs to be painted Black).
Optimal Plan Conclusion:

Given the initial positions and constraints, the robots cannot paint all tiles as per the goal pattern without violating the rules or getting stuck on tiles that need to be painted. The optimal plan involves painting as many tiles as possible before the robots are unable to proceed further.

Additional Notes:

To fully achieve the goal, the problem constraints would need to be relaxed or adjusted.
Alternatively, introducing a third robot or allowing robots to move onto painted tiles (with some limitations) could solve the issue.
Final Painted Tiles:

Black Tiles: tile_1-2, tile_2-1, tile_3-2, tile_4-1
White Tiles: tile_1-1, tile_3-1
Unpainted Tiles: tile_2-2, tile_2-3, tile_3-3, tile_4-2, tile_4-3
Goal Not Fully Achieved Due to Constraints.
