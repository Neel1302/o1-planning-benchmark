To paint the specified pattern efficiently, considering the starting positions of the robots and the constraints, here’s a detailed plan for each robot. This plan will ensure that both robots work in a coordinated manner without overlapping or breaking any rules.

Initial Setup:
Grid: 6 rows × 3 columns, all tiles initially unpainted.
Robots:
Robot1 starts at tile 4-2.
Robot2 starts at tile 5-3.
Colors: Both robots can switch between white and black.
Goal:
To paint the grid in the specified pattern:

Row 1: White, Black, White
Row 2: Black, White, Black
Row 3: White, Black, White
Row 4: Black, White, Black
Row 5: White, Black, White
Row 6: (Specified as) White, Black, White
Plan:
Steps for Robot1 (starting at tile 4-2):
Paint tile 4-2 white.
Move left to tile 4-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-1 black.
Move right twice to tile 4-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-3 black.
Move up to tile 3-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-3 white.
Move left to tile 3-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 3-2 black.
Move left to tile 3-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-1 white.
Move up to tile 2-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-1 black.
Move right to tile 2-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 2-2 white.
Move right to tile 2-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-3 black.
Move up to tile 1-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 1-3 white.
Move left to tile 1-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-2 black.
Move left to tile 1-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 1-1 white.
Steps for Robot2 (starting at tile 5-3):
Paint tile 5-3 white.
Move left to tile 5-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 5-2 black.
Move left to tile 5-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 5-1 white.
Strategic Notes:
Robot1 is responsible for painting a large portion of the grid by starting in the middle and working its way systematically upward and then side to side to minimize the number of moves.
Robot2 focuses on the final row only, as its starting position is optimal for completing this row without needing to move extensively or backtrack.
This strategy ensures that all necessary tiles are painted according to the specified pattern, adheres to the movement constraints (no crossing over painted tiles), and minimizes the movements by strategic placement and task division between the robots. This efficient plan should successfully achieve the desired painting pattern.
