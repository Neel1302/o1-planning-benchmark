Certainly! Let's develop an optimal plan for the two robots to paint the grid according to the specified pattern while strictly adhering to all the given constraints.

Problem Overview
Grid Size: 6 rows (0 to 5), 4 columns (1 to 4)
Robots:
Robot1 starts at tile_1-3
Robot2 starts at tile_1-1
Available Colors: White and Black
Movement Directions: Up, Down, Left, Right
Painting Directions: Up and Down from the robot's current position
Constraints:
Robots cannot stand on or move to painted tiles.
Robots cannot paint the tile they are currently on.
Robots can only paint unpainted tiles with their current spray gun color.
Robots can only paint tiles that are directly up or down from their current position.
Goal Pattern
We need to paint the following tiles:

Row 1:
tile_1-1: White
tile_1-2: Black
tile_1-3: White
tile_1-4: Black
Row 2:
tile_2-1: Black
tile_2-2: White
tile_2-3: Black
tile_2-4: White
Row 3:
tile_3-1: White
tile_3-2: Black
tile_3-3: White
tile_3-4: Black
Row 4:
tile_4-1: Black
tile_4-2: White
tile_4-3: Black
tile_4-4: White
Row 5:
tile_5-1: White
tile_5-2: Black
tile_5-3: White
tile_5-4: Black
Strategy
Robot1 and Robot2 will paint the tiles in columns to minimize movement and avoid conflicts.
Plan movements to ensure robots do not get trapped or violate constraints.
Maximize painting actions while minimizing steps.
Detailed Plan
Robot2's Actions
Starting Position: tile_1-1

Move Up to tile_0-1.
Change Spray Gun Color to White.
Paint Down (tile tile_1-1 is painted White).
Note: tile_1-1 is now painted and cannot be entered.
Move Right to tile_0-2.
Change Spray Gun Color to Black.
Paint Down (tile tile_1-2 is painted Black).
Note: tile_1-2 is now painted and cannot be entered.
Move Down to tile_1-2.
Cannot move onto painted tile.
Alternative: From tile_0-2, Move Right to tile_0-3.
Move Right to tile_0-3.
Change Spray Gun Color to White.
Paint Down (tile tile_1-3 is already assigned to Robot1).
Avoid conflict.
Move Right to tile_0-4.
Change Spray Gun Color to Black.
Paint Down (tile tile_1-4 is painted Black).
Note: tile_1-4 is now painted and cannot be entered.
Robot2 is now at tile_0-4 with no further moves without violating constraints.

Robot1's Actions
Starting Position: tile_1-3

Move Up to tile_0-3.
Change Spray Gun Color to White.
Paint Down (tile tile_1-3 is painted White).
Note: tile_1-3 is now painted and cannot be entered.
Move Down to tile_1-3.
Cannot move onto painted tile.
Alternative: From tile_0-3, Move Left to tile_0-2.
Conflict: Robot2 is at tile_0-2.
Wait until Robot2 vacates tile_0-2.
However, Robot2 cannot move further without violating constraints.
Alternative Plan for Robot1:
From tile_0-3, Move Left to tile_0-2 (occupied).
Cannot proceed.
Analysis
At this point, both robots are stuck:

Robot2 cannot move down from tile_0-4 because tile_1-4 is painted.
Robot1 cannot move left from tile_0-3 because tile_0-2 is occupied by Robot2.
Robots cannot move down onto painted tiles.
Robots cannot swap positions as they cannot occupy the same tile.
Alternative Approach
Given the constraints, let's try a different strategy by having the robots paint different columns.

Reassigning Tasks
Robot2 handles Column 1 and Column 2.
Robot1 handles Column 3 and Column 4.
Robot2's Revised Actions
Starting Position: tile_1-1

Move Up to tile_0-1.
Change Spray Gun Color to White.
Paint Down (tile tile_1-1 is painted White).
Move Down back to tile_1-1.
Cannot move onto painted tile.
Alternative: Stay at tile_0-1.
Move Down to tile_2-1.
**Cannot move through painted tile tile_1-1.
Alternative Route:
From tile_0-1, Move Right to tile_0-2.
Change Spray Gun Color to Black.
Paint Down (tile tile_1-2 is painted Black).
Move Down to tile_1-2.
Cannot move onto painted tile.
From tile_0-2, Move Down to tile_2-2.
**Cannot move down through painted tile tile_1-2.
Robot2 is unable to proceed further without violating constraints.

Robot1's Revised Actions
Starting Position: tile_1-3

Move Up to tile_0-3.
Change Spray Gun Color to White.
Paint Down (tile tile_1-3 is painted White).
Move Right to tile_0-4.
Change Spray Gun Color to Black.
Paint Down (tile tile_1-4 is painted Black).
Robot1 is now at tile_0-4.
Robot1 cannot move down to tile_1-4 (painted) or proceed further without violating constraints.

Challenges Identified
Robots cannot move down from row 0 to row 1 if the tile in row 1 is painted.
Robots cannot move onto or through painted tiles, limiting their movement after initial painting.
Robots cannot paint tiles they are standing on, making it impossible to paint certain required tiles from their starting positions.
Robots cannot pass each other if they are blocked by painted tiles, causing deadlock situations.
Conclusion
Under the given constraints and starting positions, it's impossible to develop an optimal plan that allows the robots to paint all the required tiles without violating the rules
