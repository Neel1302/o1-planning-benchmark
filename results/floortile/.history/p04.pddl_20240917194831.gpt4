To achieve the desired pattern for the grid with the starting positions of the robots and considering the constraints given (robots can only paint tiles directly in front or behind them and cannot move onto already painted tiles), we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves and color changes. Here’s an optimal step-by-step plan:

Initial Setup:
Grid: 5 rows × 4 columns, all tiles initially unpainted.
Robots:
Robot1 starts at tile 0-3.
Robot2 starts at tile 3-4.
Colors: Both robots can switch between white and black.
Goal:
To paint the grid in the specified pattern:

Row 1: White, Black, White, Black
Row 2: Black, White, Black, White
Row 3: White, Black, White, Black
Row 4: Black, White, Black, White
Row 5: Black, White, Black, White
Plan:
Steps for Robot1 (starting at tile 0-3):
Move down to tile 1-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 1-3 white.
Move left to tile 1-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-2 black.
Move left to tile 1-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 1-1 white.
Move right twice to tile 1-4.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-4 black.
Steps for Robot2 (starting at tile 3-4):
Paint tile 3-4 black.
Move left to tile 3-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-3 white.
Move left to tile 3-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 3-2 black.
Move left to tile 3-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-1 white.
Move down to tile 4-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-1 black.
Move right to tile 4-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 4-2 white.
Move right to tile 4-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-3 black.
Move right to tile 4-4.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 4-4 white.
Strategic Notes:
Robot1 effectively handles painting the first row from its starting position, moving only within Row 1.
Robot2 starts by painting the fourth row, working its way from right to left, and then moves to the fifth row to finish the painting from left to right.
Both robots are utilized in a way that minimizes unnecessary movements and maximizes their painting capabilities based on their starting positions and available actions.
The plan ensures that all movements are in unpainted tiles and each paint action adheres to the specified color pattern.
This methodical sequence allows each robot to operate efficiently, covering the required tiles without retracing steps or violating the movement constraints. This plan should successfully achieve the painting pattern desired with optimal robot utility.
