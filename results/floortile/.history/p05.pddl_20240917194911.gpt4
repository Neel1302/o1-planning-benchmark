To achieve the specified painting pattern for the grid with the robots starting from the given locations and considering the constraints (robots can only paint tiles directly in front or behind them and cannot move onto already painted tiles), we need a detailed plan. Here’s an optimal step-by-step strategy:

Initial Setup:
Grid: 5 rows × 4 columns, all tiles initially unpainted.
Robots:
Robot1 starts at tile 4-1.
Robot2 starts at tile 2-4.
Colors: Both robots can switch between white and black.
Goal:
To paint the grid in the specified pattern:

Row 1: White, Black, White, Black
Row 2: Black, White, Black, White
Row 3: White, Black, White, Black
Row 4: Black, White, Black, White
Row 5: Black, White, Black, White
Plan:
Steps for Robot1 (starting at tile 4-1):
Paint tile 4-1 black.
Move right to tile 4-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 4-2 white.
Move right to tile 4-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 4-3 black.
Move right to tile 4-4.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 4-4 white.
Steps for Robot2 (starting at tile 2-4):
Paint tile 2-4 white.
Move left to tile 2-3.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-3 black.
Move left to tile 2-2.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 2-2 white.
Move left to tile 2-1.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 2-1 black.
Move down to tile 3-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-1 white.
Move right to tile 3-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 3-2 black.
Move right to tile 3-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 3-3 white.
Move right to tile 3-4.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 3-4 black.
Move up to tile 1-4.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-4 black.
Move left to tile 1-3.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 1-3 white.
Move left to tile 1-2.
Change color to black.
Paint tile 1-2 black.
Move left to tile 1-1.
Change color to white.
Paint tile 1-1 white.
Strategic Notes:
Robot1 efficiently paints the entire bottom row from left to right, matching the desired pattern without the need to backtrack.
Robot2 takes on more complex tasks, handling three rows. It starts in the middle of the grid, moves to complete the current row, transitions down to complete the lower row, then moves up to finish the uppermost row.
The sequence ensures that all movements are on unpainted tiles and that each robot paints according to its immediate positioning and the spray gun's color.
This methodical sequence allows both robots to operate efficiently within their zones, covering all required tiles without retracing steps or violating movement constraints. This plan should successfully achieve the painting pattern desired with optimal robot utility.
