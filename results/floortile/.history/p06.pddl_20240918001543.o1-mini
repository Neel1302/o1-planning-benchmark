Certainly! Let's devise an optimal plan to transport the balls to their respective destinations using the three available robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper.

Problem Overview
Robots:

robot1 is initially in room2.
robot2 is initially in room1.
robot3 is initially in room2.
Balls:

ball1 is in room2 → Destination: room2 (Already there)
ball2 is in room2 → Destination: room1
ball3 is in room2 → Destination: room1
ball4 is in room2 → Destination: room1
Grippers:

Each robot has a left and right gripper.
All grippers are initially free.
Goal State
Balls:
ball1 should be in room2 ✅
ball2 should be in room1 ✅
ball3 should be in room1 ✅
ball4 should be in room1 ✅
Analysis
Balls to Move:

ball1 is already in its destination (room2); no action needed.
ball2, ball3, and ball4 are in room2 and need to be moved to room1.
Robot Allocation:

robot1 and robot3 are both in room2, where all movable balls are located.
robot2 is in room1, the destination room, and currently has no balls to manage.
Optimal Strategy:

Leverage Dual Grippers: Utilize the left and right grippers of robot1 and robot3 to carry multiple balls simultaneously.
Parallelization: Assign robot1 and robot3 to handle two balls each, minimizing the number of trips required.
Minimize Movements: Since both robot1 and robot3 are already in room2, they can immediately pick up balls without needing to relocate from their starting positions.
Optimal Plan
The optimal plan involves robot1 and robot3 each handling two balls simultaneously, thereby minimizing the total number of actions and movements required to achieve the goal.

ball3 is in room2.
robot1 is in room2.
robot1's right gripper is free.

ball3 is no longer in room2.
robot1's right gripper is occupied.
Move from room2 to room1

Action: robot1 performs move from room2 to room1.

robot1 is in room1.
Effects:
ball2 is now in room1.
robot1 is no longer carrying ball2.
robot1's left gripper is free.
Drop ball3 in room1 with Right Gripper

Action: robot1 performs right-drop on ball3.
Preconditions:
robot1 is carrying ball3 with the right gripper.
robot1 is in room1.
Effects:
ball3 is now in room1.
robot1 is no longer carrying ball3.
robot1's right gripper is free.
Robot3's Tasks (Handling ball4):
Pick Up ball4 with Left Gripper

Action: robot3 performs left-pick on ball4.
Preconditions:
ball4 is in room2.
robot3 is in room2.
robot3's left gripper is free.
Effects:
robot3 is now carrying ball4 with the left gripper.
ball4 is no longer in room2.
robot3's left gripper is occupied.
Move from room2 to room1

Action: robot3 performs move from room2 to room1.
Preconditions:
robot3 is in room2.
Effects:
robot3 is now in room1.
robot3 is no longer in room2.
Drop ball4 in room1 with Left Gripper

Action: robot3 performs left-drop on ball4.
Preconditions:
robot3 is carrying ball4 with the left gripper.
robot3 is in room1.
Effects:
ball4 is now in room1.
robot3 is no longer carrying ball4.
robot3's left gripper is free.
Robot2's Status:
robot2 is in room1, the destination room, with no balls to manage.
Action: No action needed.
Status: Remains idle unless additional tasks arise.
Summary of Actions
Step	Robot	Gripper	Action	Object	From Room	To Room	Description
1	robot1	Left	Pick	ball2	room2	-	Pick up ball2 in room2.
2	robot1	Right	Pick	ball3	room2	-	Pick up ball3 in room2.
3	robot1	-	Move	-	room2	room1	Move from room2 to room1.
4	robot1	Left	Drop	ball2	-	room1	Drop ball2 in room1.
5	robot1	Right	Drop	ball3	-	room1	Drop ball3 in room1.
6	robot3	Left	Pick	ball4	room2	-	Pick up ball4 in room2.
7	robot3	-	Move	-	room2	room1	Move from room2 to room1.
8	robot3	Left	Drop	ball4	-	room1	Drop ball4 in room1.
Final State Validation
Robots:

robot1: Located in room1, both grippers are free.
robot2: Located in room1, both grippers are free.
robot3: Located in room1, left gripper is free; right gripper was never used.
Balls:

ball1: Remains in room2 ✅
ball2: Moved to room1 ✅
ball3: Moved to room1 ✅
ball4: Moved to room1 ✅
All balls are now in their respective destination rooms as per the goal state.

Efficiency Considerations
Parallelization:

robot1 handles two balls simultaneously (ball2 and ball3) using both grippers, reducing the number of trips required.
robot3 handles the remaining ball (ball4) independently.
Action Minimization:

The plan requires a total of 8 actions, efficiently utilizing the robots' capabilities to carry multiple balls simultaneously.
Resource Optimization:

robot2 remains idle, which is optimal since there are no additional tasks. This robot can be allocated to assist with future tasks or handle unexpected scenarios, ensuring scalability.
Movement Efficiency:

Robots perform the minimum number of movements necessary to transport all required balls to their destinations.
Conclusion
The optimal plan involves:

robot1:

Handling both ball2 and ball3 simultaneously.
Moving from room2 to room1 to drop both balls.
robot3:

Handling ball4 independently.
Moving from room2 to room1 to drop the ball.
This plan ensures:

Efficient Use of Grippers: Utilizing both grippers on robot1 maximizes efficiency.
Minimal Movements: Robots make the fewest possible moves to achieve the goal.
Scalability: The idle robot2 can assist with additional tasks if they arise, allowing for flexible scaling of operations.
