To address the provided transportation planning problem, we need to optimize the movements of three h3saxs89ncG9 agents to transport the ujibqSzHx3H7 items to their designated tX2m4YtwPpHB destinations. Here's an optimal plan using the defined actions (QUSgqkO2Ywrm, wfRWLzLXzkEl, R2o0CTPiYQPT):

### Initial Setup
- **Agents:**
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_1** is in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_4**.
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_2** is in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_3** is in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**.
- **Items:**
  - **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** are in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_4**.
  - **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** is in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.

### Goal Destinations
- **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** needs to be moved to **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.
- **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** need to be moved to **tX2m4YtwPpHB_3**.

### Optimal Plan Sequence

#### Step 1: Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_1 (Stationed at tX2m4YtwPpHB_4)
1. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_4.
2. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_4 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_2 with **ujibqSzHx3H7_1**.
3. **R2o0CTPiYQPT (Unload)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 unloads **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_2.

#### Step 2: Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_2 (Initially in tX2m4YtwPpHB_2)
- **h3saxs89ncG9_2** assists in unloading or remains on standby if no other actions are required.

#### Step 3: Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_1 (Continued after unloading ujibqSzHx3H7_1)
4. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 returns to tX2m4YtwPpHB_4.
5. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_4.
6. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_4 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_3 with **ujibqSzHx3H7_2**.
7. **R2o0CTPiYQPT (Unload)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 unloads **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_3.

#### Step 4: Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_3 (Initially in tX2m4YtwPpHB_1)
8. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_1 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_2.
9. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_2.
10. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_2 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_3 with **ujibqSzHx3H7_3**.
11. **R2o0CTPiYQPT (Unload)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 unloads **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_3.

### Final State Achieved:
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2** contains **ujibqSzHx3H7_1**.
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB_3** contains **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_3**.

This plan strategically utilizes the agents' capabilities, ensuring that each ujibqSzHx3H7 is transported efficiently to its correct destination while minimizing unnecessary movements.
