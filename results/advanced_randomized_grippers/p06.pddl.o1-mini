Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to transport the `ujibqSzHx3H7` object to its designated destination using the defined actions. This plan efficiently utilizes the available agents (`h3saxs89ncG9_1` and `h3saxs89ncG9_2`) to achieve the goal with the minimal number of actions.

### **Plan Overview**

- **Agents:**
  - `h3_1`
  - `h3_2`

- **Objects:**
  - **Locations:** `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`, `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`, `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`
  - **Transport Object:** `ujibqSzHx3H7_1`
  - **Slots:** Each `h3saxs89ncG9` has two `gOfOcHaK497Z`, all initially free.

- **Actions:**
  1. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm**: Move a `h3saxs89ncG9` from one location to another.
  2. **wfRWLzLXzkEl**: Load a `ujibqSzHx3H7` onto a `h3saxs89ncG9`.
  3. **R2o0CTPiYQPT**: Unload a `ujibqSzHx3H7` from a `h3saxs89ncG9`.

### **Initial State**

- **Agents:**
  - `h3_1` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`.
  - `h3_2` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.

- **Transport Object:**
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

- **Slots:**
  - All `gOfOcHaK497Z` are free.

- **Goal:**
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` should be in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`.

### **Analysis of the Problem**

- **Current Positions:**
  - The transport object `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `h3_1` is already at the **destination** (`tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`).
  - `h3_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`, which is closer to the **source** (`tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`).

- **Optimal Agent Selection:**
  - **`h3_2`** is closer to the source location and can perform the transport efficiently without requiring additional movements by `h3_1`.

### **Optimal Plan**

The optimal plan involves `h3_2` performing the following sequence of actions to transport `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`.

#### **Step-by-Step Actions**

1. **Move `h3_2` from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_2`
   - **Action:** `QUSgqkO2Ywrm`
   - **Details:** Transport from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

2. **Load `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` onto `h3_2` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_2`
   - **Action:** `wfRWLzLXzkEl`
   - **Details:** Load `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` using one free `gOfOcHaK497Z` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

3. **Move `h3_2` from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_2`
   - **Action:** `QUSgqkO2Ywrm`
   - **Details:** Transport from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3` while carrying `ujibqSzHx3H7_1`.

4. **Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` from `h3_2` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_2`
   - **Action:** `R2o0CTPiYQPT`
   - **Details:** Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`.

#### **Action Sequence Table**

| Step | Agent  | Action             | Details                                        |
|------|--------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | h3_2   | QUSgqkO2Ywrm       | Move from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` |
| 2    | h3_2   | wfRWLzLXzkEl       | Load `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`      |
| 3    | h3_2   | QUSgqkO2Ywrm       | Move from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3` |
| 4    | h3_2   | R2o0CTPiYQPT       | Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`    |

### **Summary of the Plan**

- **Total Actions:** 4
- **Agent Utilization:**
  - **`h3_2`:** Handles the entire transportation process, minimizing the total number of actions.
  - **`h3_1`:** Remains idle as its involvement is unnecessary for this specific task.

### **Final State**

- **Transport Object:**
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`.

- **Agents:**
  - `h3_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`.
  - `h3_1` remains at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`.

This plan ensures that the `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` object is transported to its designated destination in the minimal number of actions by effectively utilizing the available agent.
