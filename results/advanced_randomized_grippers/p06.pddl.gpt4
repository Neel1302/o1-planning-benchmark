To solve the given planning problem effectively, we'll utilize the h3saxs89ncG9 agents and their capabilities to efficiently move the single ujibqSzHx3H7 item to its destination, tX2m4YtwPpHB_3. Here is an optimal plan to achieve the desired outcome using the defined actions (QUSgqkO2Ywrm, wfRWLzLXzkEl, R2o0CTPiYQPT):

### Initial Setup
- **Agents:**
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_1** is in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_3**.
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_2** is in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.
- **Item:**
  - **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** is in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**.

### Goal
- **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** needs to be moved to **tX2m4YtwPpHB_3**.

### Optimal Plan Sequence

#### Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_2 (Stationed at tX2m4YtwPpHB_2)
1. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_2 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_2 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_1.
2. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_2 loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_1.
3. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_2 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_1 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_3 with **ujibqSzHx3H7_1**.
4. **R2o0CTPiYQPT (Unload)**: h3saxs89ncG9_2 unloads **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_3.

#### Role of h3saxs89ncG9_1 (Stationed at tX2m4YtwPpHB_3)
- **h3saxs89ncG9_1** does not need to perform any actions since **h3saxs89ncG9_2** can handle the transportation of **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** effectively. It remains on standby unless further actions are necessary after **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** is delivered.

### Final State Achieved:
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB_3** contains **ujibqSzHx3H7_1**.

This plan ensures minimal movement and maximizes efficiency by utilizing h3saxs89ncG9_2 to complete the transportation of the item from its initial location directly to the destination, with h3saxs89ncG9_1 remaining at the destination to potentially assist or confirm the successful delivery.
