To solve this planning problem optimally, I'll first clarify the terminology and then provide a sequence of actions that achieves your goal.

**Terminology Deciphered:**

- **h3saxs89ncG9**: **Robot**
- **gOfOcHaK497Z**: **Gripper**
- **QUSgqkO2Ywrm**: **Move**
- **ujibqSzHx3H7**: **Object**
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB**: **Location**
- **RmkNTPUk7STW**: **At**
- **W4jJaSfDJP72**: **Not at**
- **wfRWLzLXzkEl**: **Pick-up**
- **J8xN6H9Yepyh**: **Empty gripper**
- **nszdIOOHZNQ8**: **Full gripper**
- **JNc8qalbbQ0o**: **Holding an object**
- **R2o0CTPiYQPT**: **Drop-off**
- **iyK2OXlGaPYz**: **Not holding an object**

---

**Initial State:**

- **Robots:**
  - **Robot 1** is at **Location 4**.
  - **Robot 2** is at **Location 4**.
  - **Robot 3** is at **Location 1**.
- **Objects:**
  - **Object 1** is at **Location 1**; needs to remain at **Location 1**.
  - **Object 2** is at **Location 1**; needs to remain at **Location 1**.
  - **Object 3** is at **Location 1**; needs to go to **Location 3**.
  - **Object 4** is at **Location 2**; needs to remain at **Location 2**.
- **Grippers:** All grippers are empty.

---

**Goal:**

- **Object 3** must be transported from **Location 1** to **Location 3**.
- All other objects are already at their desired locations.

---

**Optimal Plan:**

Since **Robot 3** is already at **Location 1**, it can efficiently handle the transportation of **Object 3**.

**Sequence of Actions:**

1. **Pick Up Object 3 at Location 1:**

   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot3, Object3, Location1, GripperA)`
     - **Robot 3** uses **Gripper A** to pick up **Object 3**.
     - **Gripper A** changes from **J8xN6H9Yepyh** (empty) to **nszdIOOHZNQ8** (full).
     - **Robot 3** is now **JNc8qalbbQ0o** (holding an object).
     - **Object 3** is **W4jJaSfDJP72** (not at) **Location 1**.

2. **Move Robot 3 from Location 1 to Location 3:**

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot3, Location1, Location3)`
     - **Robot 3** is now **RmkNTPUk7STW** (at) **Location 3**.
     - It is **W4jJaSfDJP72** (not at) **Location 1**.

3. **Drop Off Object 3 at Location 3:**

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot3, Object3, Location3, GripperA)`
     - **Robot 3** releases **Object 3** at **Location 3**.
     - **Gripper A** changes from **nszdIOOHZNQ8** (full) back to **J8xN6H9Yepyh** (empty).
     - **Robot 3** is now **iyK2OXlGaPYz** (not holding an object).
     - **Object 3** is now **RmkNTPUk7STW** (at) **Location 3**.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Robot 3** efficiently completes the task with minimal actions:
  - **1 Pick-up**, **1 Move**, and **1 Drop-off**.
- No other robots or grippers are involved, ensuring optimal resource utilization.
- **Objects 1, 2, and 4** are already at their desired locations and require no action.

---

**Final State:**

- **Object 1** remains at **Location 1**.
- **Object 2** remains at **Location 1**.
- **Object 3** is now at **Location 3**.
- **Object 4** remains at **Location 2**.
- All robots have empty grippers and are not holding any objects.

---

**Conclusion:**

This plan is optimal because it:

- **Minimizes the number of actions**: Only three actions are needed.
- **Utilizes the closest robot**: **Robot 3** is already at the starting location.
- **Avoids unnecessary movements**: Other robots remain stationary.
- **Achieves the goal efficiently**, satisfying all the conditions of the problem.

By following this sequence, **Object 3** is successfully transported to **Location 3**, and all objectives are met in the most efficient manner.
