---

### **Initial State:**

- **Robots:**

  - **Robot 1** is at **Location 1**.
  - **Robot 2** is at **Location 1**.
  - **Robot 3** is at **Location 2**.

- **Objects:**

  - **Object 1** is at **Location 2**; needs to **remain** at **Location 2**.
  - **Object 2** is at **Location 2**; needs to be moved to **Location 1**.
  - **Object 3** is at **Location 2**; needs to be moved to **Location 1**.
  - **Object 4** is at **Location 2**; needs to be moved to **Location 1**.

- **Grippers:**

  - All grippers are **empty**.

---

### **Goal:**

- **Transport Objects 2, 3, and 4 to Location 1**.
- **Object 1** remains at **Location 2**.

---

### **Optimal Plan:**

#### **Robot 3 (At Location 2):**

1. **Pick up Object 2 using Gripper A:**

   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot3, Object2, Location2, GripperA)`
   - **Effect:** Robot 3 is holding Object 2; Gripper A is now full.

2. **Pick up Object 3 using Gripper B:**

   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot3, Object3, Location2, GripperB)`
   - **Effect:** Robot 3 is also holding Object 3; Gripper B is now full.

3. **Move to Location 1:**

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot3, Location2, Location1)`
   - **Effect:** Robot 3 is now at Location 1.

4. **Drop off Object 2 at Location 1:**

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot3, Object2, Location1, GripperA)`
   - **Effect:** Object 2 is now at Location 1; Gripper A is empty.

5. **Drop off Object 3 at Location 1:**

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot3, Object3, Location1, GripperB)`
   - **Effect:** Object 3 is now at Location 1; Gripper B is empty.

#### **Robot 1 (At Location 1):**

6. **Move to Location 2:**

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location1, Location2)`
   - **Effect:** Robot 1 is now at Location 2.

7. **Pick up Object 4 using Gripper A:**

   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object4, Location2, GripperA)`
   - **Effect:** Robot 1 is holding Object 4; Gripper A is now full.

8. **Move back to Location 1:**

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location2, Location1)`
   - **Effect:** Robot 1 is now at Location 1.

9. **Drop off Object 4 at Location 1:**

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object4, Location1, GripperA)`
   - **Effect:** Object 4 is now at Location 1; Gripper A is empty.

---

### **Explanation:**

- **Robot 3** efficiently transports **Objects 2 and 3** by utilizing both grippers, reducing the number of trips needed.
- **Robot 1** assists by transporting **Object 4** from Location 2 to Location 1.
- **Robot 2** remains idle as the tasks are optimally completed by Robots 1 and 3.
- This plan minimizes the total number of actions while ensuring all objects reach their destinations.

---

### **Total Actions:**

- **Robot 3:**

  - Pick-up Actions: 2
  - Move Actions: 1
  - Drop-off Actions: 2
  - **Total:** **5 actions**

- **Robot 1:**

  - Move Actions: 2
  - Pick-up Actions: 1
  - Drop-off Actions: 1
  - **Total:** **4 actions**

- **Overall Total Actions:** **9**

---

### **Final State:**

- **Object 1** remains at **Location 2**.
- **Objects 2, 3, and 4** are now at **Location 1**.
- **All robots** have empty grippers and are ready for new tasks.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This plan is optimal because it:

- **Minimizes the number of actions** by effectively utilizing the robots' capacities.
- **Reduces travel time** by assigning tasks based on each robot's starting location.
- **Ensures efficient resource utilization**, with no unnecessary movements or idle time.

By following this sequence, all objects reach their intended destinations efficiently, fulfilling all the requirements of the problem.
