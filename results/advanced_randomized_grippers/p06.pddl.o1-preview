**Terminology Deciphered:**

- **h3saxs89ncG9**: **Robot**
- **gOfOcHaK497Z**: **Gripper**
- **QUSgqkO2Ywrm**: **Move**
- **ujibqSzHx3H7**: **Object**
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB**: **Location**
- **RmkNTPUk7STW**: **At**
- **W4jJaSfDJP72**: **Not at**

**Initial State:**

- **Robots:**
  - **Robot 1** is at **Location 3**.
  - **Robot 2** is at **Location 2**.
- **Object:**
  - **Object 1** is at **Location 1**.
- **Grippers:**
  - All grippers are **empty**.

---

**Goal:**

- **Transport Object 1 to Location 3**.

---

**Optimal Plan:**

Since **Robot 2** is closer to **Location 1**, it is optimal for **Robot 2** to perform the task.

**Sequence of Actions:**

1. **Robot 2 Moves from Location 2 to Location 1:**

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot2, Location2, Location1)`
   - **Effect:**
     - **Robot 2** is now **at** **Location 1**.
     - **Robot 2** is **not at** **Location 2**.

2. **Robot 2 Picks Up Object 1 at Location 1:**

   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot2, Object1, Location1, GripperA)`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - **Object 1** is **at** **Location 1**.
     - **Robot 2** is **at** **Location 1**.
     - **Gripper A** is **empty**.
   - **Effect:**
     - **Robot 2** is now **holding** **Object 1**.
     - **Gripper A** changes from **empty** to **full**.
     - **Object 1** is **not at** **Location 1**.

3. **Robot 2 Moves from Location 1 to Location 3:**

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot2, Location1, Location3)`
   - **Effect:**
     - **Robot 2** is now **at** **Location 3**.
     - **Robot 2** is **not at** **Location 1**.

4. **Robot 2 Drops Off Object 1 at Location 3:**

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot2, Object1, Location3, GripperA)`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - **Robot 2** is **holding** **Object 1** using **Gripper A**.
     - **Robot 2** is **at** **Location 3**.
   - **Effect:**
     - **Robot 2** is **not holding** **Object 1**.
     - **Gripper A** changes from **full** to **empty**.
     - **Object 1** is now **at** **Location 3**.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Robot 2** efficiently completes the task with minimal actions:
  - **2 Move actions**, **1 Pick-up action**, and **1 Drop-off action**.
- **Robot 1** remains idle since it is already at the destination (**Location 3**) and is farther from **Object 1**.
- This plan minimizes the total number of actions and optimizes resource utilization.

---

**Final State:**

- **Object 1** is at **Location 3** (goal achieved).
- **Robot 2** is at **Location 3** with both grippers empty.
- **Robot 1** remains at **Location 3** with both grippers empty.

---

**Conclusion:**

By following this optimal plan, **Object 1** is successfully transported to **Location 3** in the most efficient manner, achieving your goal with minimal actions.
