### **Summary of the Plan**

- **Total Actions:** 8
- **Agent Utilization:**
  - **`h3_1`:** Handles the transportation of `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` and `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` in a single trip by utilizing both `gOfOcHaK497Z` slots.
  - **`h3_2`:** Handles the transportation of `ujibqSzHx3H7_3`.
  - **`h3_3`:** Remains idle as there are no objects to transport from its current location (`tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`).

---

### **Final State**

- **Transport Objects:**
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` is at `tX3`.

- **Agents:**
  - `h3_1` is at `tX3`.
  - `h3_2` is at `tX3`.
  - `h3_3` remains at `tX1`.

---

### **Rationale for Optimality**

- **Minimized Actions:** By allowing `h3_1` to carry two objects (`ujibq_1` and `ujibq_2`) simultaneously, we reduce the total number of actions compared to handling each object individually.
  
- **Parallel Processing:** Utilizing `h3_2` to transport `ujibq_3` concurrently ensures that the transportation process is efficient and time-effective.

- **Efficient Agent Usage:** `h3_3` remains idle as involving it would not contribute to further optimizing the plan, given the current distribution of objects and goals.

This plan ensures that all `ujibqSzHx3H7` objects are transported to their respective destinations in the minimal number of actions by effectively utilizing the available agents and their capacities.
