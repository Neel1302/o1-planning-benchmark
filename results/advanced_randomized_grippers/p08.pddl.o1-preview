**Initial State:**

- **Robots:**
  - **Robot 1** is at **Location 2**.
  - **Robot 2** is at **Location 1**.
  - **Robot 3** is at **Location 2**.
- **Objects:**
  - **Object 1** is at **Location 2**; needs to go to **Location 1**.
  - **Object 2** is at **Location 2**; needs to go to **Location 1**.
  - **Object 3** is at **Location 1**; needs to go to **Location 2**.
  - **Object 4** is at **Location 2**; needs to go to **Location 1**.
  - **Object 5** is at **Location 1**; already at its destination.
- **Grippers:** All grippers are **empty**.

---

**Goal:**

- **Transport Objects to Their Destinations:**
  - **Object 1** to **Location 1**.
  - **Object 2** to **Location 1**.
  - **Object 3** to **Location 2**.
  - **Object 4** to **Location 1**.
  - **Object 5** remains at **Location 1**.

---

**Optimal Plan:**

1. **At Location 2 (Robots 1 and 3):**

   - **Robot 1** picks up **Object 1** using **Gripper A**:
     - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object1, Location2, GripperA)`
   - **Robot 1** picks up **Object 2** using **Gripper B**:
     - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object2, Location2, GripperB)`
   - **Robot 3** picks up **Object 4** using **Gripper A**:
     - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot3, Object4, Location2, GripperA)`

2. **Robots Move to Location 1:**

   - **Robot 1** moves to **Location 1**:
     - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location2, Location1)`
   - **Robot 3** moves to **Location 1**:
     - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot3, Location2, Location1)`

3. **At Location 1 (Robots 1 and 3):**

   - **Robot 1** drops off **Object 1** using **Gripper A**:
     - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object1, Location1, GripperA)`
   - **Robot 1** drops off **Object 2** using **Gripper B**:
     - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object2, Location1, GripperB)`
   - **Robot 3** drops off **Object 4** using **Gripper A**:
     - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot3, Object4, Location1, GripperA)`

4. **At Location 1 (Robot 2):**

   - **Robot 2** picks up **Object 3** using **Gripper A**:
     - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot2, Object3, Location1, GripperA)`

5. **Robot 2 Moves to Location 2:**

   - **Robot 2** moves to **Location 2**:
     - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot2, Location1, Location2)`

6. **At Location 2 (Robot 2):**

   - **Robot 2** drops off **Object 3** using **Gripper A**:
     - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot2, Object3, Location2, GripperA)`

**Explanation:**

- **Robots 1 and 3** at **Location 2**:
  - **Robot 1** uses both grippers to pick up **Objects 1 and 2**.
  - **Robot 3** picks up **Object 4**.
  - Both robots move to **Location 1**.
  - They drop off their respective objects at **Location 1**.
- **Robot 2** at **Location 1**:
  - Picks up **Object 3**.
  - Moves to **Location 2**.
  - Drops off **Object 3** at **Location 2**.
- **Object 5** remains at **Location 1**, requiring no action.

---

**Total Actions:**

- **Robot 1:**
  - **Pick-up Actions:** 2 (Objects 1 and 2)
  - **Move Actions:** 1
  - **Drop-off Actions:** 2
  - **Total Actions:** **5**
- **Robot 3:**
  - **Pick-up Actions:** 1 (Object 4)
  - **Move Actions:** 1
  - **Drop-off Actions:** 1
  - **Total Actions:** **3**
- **Robot 2:**
  - **Pick-up Actions:** 1 (Object 3)
  - **Move Actions:** 1
  - **Drop-off Actions:** 1
  - **Total Actions:** **3**

**Overall Total Actions:** **11**

---

**Final State:**

- **Object 1** is at **Location 1**.
- **Object 2** is at **Location 1**.
- **Object 3** is at **Location 2**.
- **Object 4** is at **Location 1**.
- **Object 5** remains at **Location 1**.
- All robots have empty grippers and are ready for new tasks.

---

**Conclusion:**

This plan is optimal because it:

- **Minimizes the total number of actions** by efficiently utilizing the robots and their grippers.
- **Maximizes carrying capacity** by having robots use both grippers when possible.
- **Reduces unnecessary movements** by assigning robots already near the objects.
- **Achieves all goals efficiently**, ensuring all objects reach their destinations with minimal resource usage.

By following this sequence, all objects are delivered to their intended locations in the most efficient manner possible.
