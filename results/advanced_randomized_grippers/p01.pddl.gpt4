It appears there's a bit of confusion in the problem setup, as the goals seem already achieved based on the provided initial conditions. Both `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` and `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` are already positioned at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`, which is where they are meant to be according to the goal. However, I'll approach this as if the goal for `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` is to be at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2` for clarity and to provide a possible solution if that was the intended scenario.

### Current Setup:
- Two `h3saxs89ncG9` robots (Robot 1 and Robot 2), each with two grippers (`gOfOcHaK497Z`), are all in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
- Two objects (`ujibqSzHx3H7_1` and `ujibqSzHx3H7_2`), are also in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
- The goal is to have `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` remain at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` and `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` moved to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.

### Plan:
1. **Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl`**
   - **Actor:** `h3saxs89ncG9_2`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `h3saxs89ncG9_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
     - `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
     - `gOfOcHaK497Z` of `h3saxs89ncG9_2` is available.
   - **Effects:**
     - Gripper of `h3saxs89ncG9_2` grips `ujibqSzHx3H7_2`.
     - `h3saxs89ncG9_2` changes state to being ready to transport (`JNc8qalbbQ0o`).

2. **Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm`**
   - **Actor:** `h3saxs89ncG9_2`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `h3saxs89ncG9_2` is ready to move (`JNc8qalbbQ0o` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`).
   - **Effects:**
     - Move `h3saxs89ncG9_2` from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2` with `ujibqSzHx3H7_2`.

3. **Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT`**
   - **Actor:** `h3saxs89ncG9_2`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `h3saxs89ncG9_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2` with `ujibqSzHx3H7_2`.
   - **Effects:**
     - Place `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.
     - Gripper returns to ready state.

### Final State:
- `h3saxs89ncG9_1` remains at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` with `ujibqSzHx3H7_1`.
- `h3saxs89ncG9_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2` with `ujibqSzHx3H7_2`.
- `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` remains at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
- `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` is relocated to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.

This plan assumes movement is possible between the two locations and the robots operate independently without interference.
