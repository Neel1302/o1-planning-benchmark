To address the planning problem effectively, we'll create a sequence of actions that optimizes the use of the h3saxs89ncG9 agents and their gOfOcHaK497Z capabilities to transport the ujibqSzHx3H7 items to their designated tX2m4YtwPpHB locations.

### Initial Setup
- **Agents:**
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_1** and **h3saxs89ncG9_2** are at **tX2m4YtwPpHB_4**.
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_3** is at **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**.
- **Items:**
  - **ujibqSzHx3H7_1**, **ujibqSzHx3H7_2**, and **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** are at **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**.
  - **ujibqSzHx3H7_4** is at **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.

### Destinations
- **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** remain in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**.
- **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** needs to be moved to **tX2m4YtwPpHB_3**.
- **ujibqSzHx3H7_4** needs to stay in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.

### Optimal Plan Sequence

#### Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_3 (Stationed at tX2m4YtwPpHB_1)
- No action required for **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** as they are already at their destination.

1. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** from tX2m4YtwPpHB_1.
2. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_1 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_3 with **ujibqSzHx3H7_3**.
3. **R2o0CTPiYQPT (Unload)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 unloads **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_3.

#### Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_1 and h3saxs89ncG9_2 (Stationed at tX2m4YtwPpHB_4)
- No direct action is required from h3saxs89ncG9_1 and h3saxs89ncG9_2 for moving any items since h3saxs89ncG9_3 can handle all item movements efficiently. 
- **Note**: Since **ujibqSzHx3H7_4** is already at its destination **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**, and there's no mention of any other destinations or additional tasks, agents h3saxs89ncG9_1 and h3saxs89ncG9_2 do not need to move or perform actions unless new requirements are specified.

### Final State Achieved:
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1** contains **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_2**.
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2** contains **ujibqSzHx3H7_4**.
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB_3** contains **ujibqSzHx3H7_3**.

This plan ensures minimal movement, efficient use of agent capabilities, and adherence to the constraints provided by the initial and target configurations.
