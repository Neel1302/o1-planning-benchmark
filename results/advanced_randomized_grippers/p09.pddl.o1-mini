### **Rationale for Optimality**

- **Minimized Actions:** By assigning each agent specific tasks based on their starting locations, we reduce unnecessary movements and ensure that each action contributes directly to achieving the goals.
  
- **Parallel Processing:** Utilizing all three agents concurrently allows multiple objects to be transported simultaneously, effectively reducing the total time required.

- **Maximized Capacity Usage:** Agents `h3_1` and `h3_2` carry two objects each when possible, optimizing their carrying capacities and minimizing the number of trips needed.

- **Efficient Agent Utilization:** Each agent is assigned tasks that align with their current locations and the destinations of the objects they are responsible for, ensuring that no agent is idle unnecessarily or moving without purpose.

This plan ensures that all `ujibqSzHx3H7` objects are transported to their respective destinations in the minimal number of actions by effectively utilizing the available agents and their capacities.
