To solve this planning problem optimally, I'll first clarify the terminology and then provide a sequence of actions that achieves the goal.

**Terminology Deciphered:**

- **h3saxs89ncG9**: **Robot**
- **gOfOcHaK497Z**: **Gripper**
- **QUSgqkO2Ywrm**: **Move action**
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB**: **Location**
- **RmkNTPUk7STW**: **At**
- **W4jJaSfDJP72**: **Not at**
- **ujibqSzHx3H7**: **Object**
- **wfRWLzLXzkEl**: **Pick-up action**
- **J8xN6H9Yepyh**: **Empty gripper**
- **nszdIOOHZNQ8**: **Full gripper**
- **JNc8qalbbQ0o**: **Holding an object**
- **R2o0CTPiYQPT**: **Drop-off action**
- **iyK2OXlGaPYz**: **Not holding an object**

**Initial State:**

- **Robots:**
  - **Robot 1** is **at Location 1** with two empty grippers.
  - **Robot 2** is **at Location 2** with two empty grippers.
- **Objects:**
  - **Object 1** is **at Location 1**; needs to go to **Location 5**.
  - **Object 2** is **at Location 1**; needs to go to **Location 4**.
- **Locations:** There are 5 locations: **Location 1**, **Location 2**, **Location 3**, **Location 4**, **Location 5**.

---

**Optimal Plan:**

We will utilize **Robot 1** to transport both objects efficiently using its two grippers.

1. **At Location 1:**
   - **Robot 1** picks up **Object 1** using **Gripper A**:
     - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object1, Location1, GripperA)`
   - **Robot 1** picks up **Object 2** using **Gripper B**:
     - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object2, Location1, GripperB)`

2. **Robot 1 moves** to **Location 4**:
   - Move from **Location 1** to **Location 2**:
     - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location1, Location2)`
   - Move from **Location 2** to **Location 3**:
     - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location2, Location3)`
   - Move from **Location 3** to **Location 4**:
     - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location3, Location4)`

3. **At Location 4:**
   - **Robot 1** drops off **Object 2** using **Gripper B**:
     - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object2, Location4, GripperB)`

4. **Robot 1 moves** to **Location 5**:
   - Move from **Location 4** to **Location 5**:
     - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location4, Location5)`

5. **At Location 5:**
   - **Robot 1** drops off **Object 1** using **Gripper A**:
     - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object1, Location5, GripperA)`

---

**Explanation:**

- **Robot 1** uses both grippers to carry **Object 1** and **Object 2** simultaneously.
- By moving first to **Location 4**, **Robot 1** efficiently drops off **Object 2** at its destination without extra trips.
- Continuing to **Location 5**, **Robot 1** completes the delivery of **Object 1**.
- **Robot 2** remains idle because the tasks can be completed optimally with **Robot 1** alone.

---

**Total Actions:**

1. **Pick-up Actions:** 2
2. **Move Actions:** 4
3. **Drop-off Actions:** 2
4. **Total Actions:** **8**

---

**Final State:**

- **Object 1** is **at Location 5**.
- **Object 2** is **at Location 4**.
- Both robots have their grippers empty and are free for new tasks.

---

**Conclusion:**

This plan is optimal because it:

- **Minimizes the total number of actions** by utilizing both grippers.
- **Reduces movement time** by delivering objects in a single trip.
- **Eliminates unnecessary use** of the second robot, conserving resources.

By following this sequence, all objects are delivered to their respective destinations in the most efficient manner.
