**Terminology Deciphered:**

- **h3saxs89ncG9**: **Robot**
- **gOfOcHaK497Z**: **Gripper**
- **QUSgqkO2Ywrm**: **Move**
- **ujibqSzHx3H7**: **Object**
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB**: **Location**
- **RmkNTPUk7STW**: **At**

- **JNc8qalbbQ0o**: **Holding an object**
- **R2o0CTPiYQPT**: **Drop-off**
- **iyK2OXlGaPYz**: **Not holding an object**

**Initial State:**

- **Robots:**
  - **Robot 1** is at **Location 4**.
  - **Robot 2** is at **Location 2**.
  - **Robot 3** is at **Location 1**.
- **Objects:**
  - **Object 1** is at **Location 4**; needs to go to **Location 2**.
  - **Object 2** is at **Location 4**; needs to go to **Location 3**.
  - **Object 3** is at **Location 2**; needs to go to **Location 3**.
- **Grippers:** All grippers are **empty**.

---

**Goal:**

- **Transport Object 1 to Location 2**.
- **Transport Object 2 to Location 3**.
- **Transport Object 3 to Location 3**.

---

**Optimal Plan:**

1. **At Location 4 (Robot 1):**

   - **Pick up Object 1 using Gripper A:**
     - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object1, Location4, GripperA)`
   - **Pick up Object 2 using Gripper B:**
     - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object2, Location4, GripperB)`

2. **Robot 1 moves from Location 4 to Location 2:**

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location4, Location2)`

3. **At Location 2 (Robot 1):**

   - **Drop off Object 1 using Gripper A:**
     - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object1, Location2, GripperA)`

4. **Robot 1 moves from Location 2 to Location 3:**

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location2, Location3)`

5. **At Location 3 (Robot 1):**

   - **Drop off Object 2 using Gripper B:**
     - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object2, Location3, GripperB)`

6. **At Location 2 (Robot 2):**

   - **Pick up Object 3 using Gripper A:**
     - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot2, Object3, Location2, GripperA)`

7. **Robot 2 moves from Location 2 to Location 3:**

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot2, Location2, Location3)`

8. **At Location 3 (Robot 2):**

   - **Drop off Object 3 using Gripper A:**
     - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot2, Object3, Location3, GripperA)`

---

**Explanation:**

- **Robot 1** utilizes both grippers to carry **Object 1** and **Object 2** simultaneously.
  - Picks up both objects at **Location 4**.
  - Moves to **Location 2** to drop off **Object 1** (its destination).
  - Continues to **Location 3** to drop off **Object 2**.
- **Robot 2** is already at **Location 2** where **Object 3** is located.
  - Picks up **Object 3**.
  - Moves directly to **Location 3** to drop it off.
- **Robot 3** remains idle because the tasks are optimally completed by **Robot 1** and **Robot 2**.

---

**Total Actions:**

- **Robot 1:**
  - 2 Pick-up actions
  - 2 Move actions
  - 2 Drop-off actions
  - **Total:** 6 actions
- **Robot 2:**
  - 1 Pick-up action
  - 1 Move action
  - 1 Drop-off action
  - **Total:** 3 actions
- **Overall Total Actions:** **9**

---

**Final State:**

- **Object 1** is at **Location 2**.
- **Object 2** is at **Location 3**.
- **Object 3** is at **Location 3**.
- All robots have empty grippers and are ready for new tasks.

---

**Conclusion:**

This plan is optimal because it:

- **Minimizes the number of actions** by efficiently using the robots and their grippers.
- **Utilizes both grippers of Robot 1** to transport two objects in a single trip.
- **Assigns Robot 2** to transport **Object 3** without unnecessary movements.
- **Avoids involving Robot 3**, as it does not contribute to a more efficient solution.

By following this sequence, all objects reach their destinations with the least amount of time and resources, achieving the goal efficiently.
