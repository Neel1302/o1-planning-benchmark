Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to transport the `ujibqSzHx3H7` objects to their respective destinations using the defined actions. This plan efficiently utilizes the available agents (`h3saxs89ncG9_1` and `h3saxs89ncG9_2`) to achieve the goal with the minimal number of actions.

### **Plan Overview**

- **Agents:**
  - `h3_1`
  - `h3_2`

- **Objects:**
  - **Locations:** `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`, `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`
  - **Transport Objects:** `ujibqSzHx3H7_1`, `ujibqSzHx3H7_2`, `ujibqSzHx3H7_3`, `ujibqSzHx3H7_4`, `ujibqSzHx3H7_5`
  - **Slots:** Each `h3saxs89ncG9` has two `gOfOcHaK497Z`, all initially free.

- **Actions:**
  1. **wfRWLzLXzkEl**: Load a `ujibqSzHx3H7` onto a `h3saxs89ncG9`.
  2. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm**: Move a `h3saxs89ncG9` from one location to another.
  3. **R2o0CTPiYQPT**: Unload a `ujibqSzHx3H7` from a `h3saxs89ncG9`.

### **Initial State**

- **Agents:**
  - `h3_1` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.
  - `h3_2` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

- **Transport Objects:**
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_4` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_5` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

- **Slots:**
  - All `gOfOcHaK497Z` are free.

- **Goals:**
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` should be in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` should be in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` should be in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_4` should be in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_5` should be in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

### **Analysis of the Problem**

Upon reviewing the initial and goal states:

- **`ujibqSzHx3H7_1`**, **`ujibqSzHx3H7_2`**, **`ujibqSzHx3H7_4`**, and **`ujibqSzHx3H7_5`** are already in their respective destinations (`tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`).
- **`ujibqSzHx3H7_3`** needs to be moved from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.

Therefore, the optimal plan focuses solely on transporting **`ujibqSzHx3H7_3`**.

### **Optimal Plan**

Given that `h3_2` is already located at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`, where `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` is situated, we will utilize `h3_2` to perform the transportation efficiently. The other agent, `h3_1`, will remain idle as its involvement is unnecessary for this specific task.

#### **Step-by-Step Actions**

1. **Load `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` onto `h3_2` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_2`
   - **Action:** `wfRWLzLXzkEl`
   - **Details:** Load `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` using one free `gOfOcHaK497Z` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

2. **Move `h3_2` from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_2`
   - **Action:** `QUSgqkO2Ywrm`
   - **Details:** Transport from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2` while carrying `ujibqSzHx3H7_3`.

3. **Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` from `h3_2` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_2`
   - **Action:** `R2o0CTPiYQPT`
   - **Details:** Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.

#### **Action Sequence Table**

| Step | Agent  | Action             | Details                                        |
|------|--------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | h3_2   | wfRWLzLXzkEl       | Load `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`      |
| 2    | h3_2   | QUSgqkO2Ywrm       | Move to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`                       |
| 3    | h3_2   | R2o0CTPiYQPT       | Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`    |

### **Summary of the Plan**

- **Total Actions:** 3
- **Agent Utilization:**
  - **`h3_2`:** Handles the entire transportation of `ujibqSzHx3H7_3`, minimizing the total number of actions.
  - **`h3_1`:** Remains idle as it is not needed for this specific task.

### **Final State**

- **Transport Objects:**
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_4` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_5` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

- **Agents:**
  - `h3_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.
  - `h3_1` remains at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.

This plan ensures that all `ujibqSzHx3H7` objects are at their respective destinations with the minimal number of actions by effectively utilizing the available agent.
