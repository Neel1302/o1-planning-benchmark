---

### **Optimal Plan:**

#### **Robot 1 (At Location 4):**

1. **Pick up Object 1** using **Gripper A**:

   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object1, Location4, GripperA)`

2. **Move to Location 1**:

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location4, Location1)`

3. **At Location 1, drop off Object 1**:

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object1, Location1, GripperA)`

4. **Pick up Object 6** using **Gripper A**:

   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object6, Location1, GripperA)`

5. **Move to Location 2**:

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location1, Location2)`

6. **At Location 2, drop off Object 6**:

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object6, Location2, GripperA)`

7. **Pick up Object 4** using **Gripper A** and **Object 5** using **Gripper B**:

   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object4, Location2, GripperA)`
   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot1, Object5, Location2, GripperB)`

8. **Move to Location 3**:

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location2, Location3)`

9. **At Location 3, drop off Object 5**:

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object5, Location3, GripperB)`

10. **Move to Location 4**:

    - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot1, Location3, Location4)`

11. **At Location 4, drop off Object 4**:

    - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot1, Object4, Location4, GripperA)`

---

#### **Robot 3 (At Location 3):**

1. **Pick up Object 2** using **Gripper A** and **Object 7** using **Gripper B**:

   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot3, Object2, Location3, GripperA)`
   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot3, Object7, Location3, GripperB)`

2. **Move to Location 1**:

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot3, Location3, Location1)`

3. **At Location 1, drop off Object 7**:

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot3, Object7, Location1, GripperB)`

4. **Move to Location 4**:

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot3, Location1, Location4)`

5. **At Location 4, drop off Object 2**:

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot3, Object2, Location4, GripperA)`

---

#### **Robot 2 (At Location 1):**

1. **Idle or assist if necessary**, but in this plan, **Robot 2** is not required, as the tasks are optimally handled by **Robots 1 and 3**.

---

### **Explanation:**

- **Robot 1** efficiently transports **Object 1** to **Location 1** and then picks up **Object 6** to deliver it to **Location 2**.
- At **Location 2**, **Robot 1** picks up **Object 4** and **Object 5** using both grippers, maximizing carrying capacity.
- **Robot 1** drops off **Object 5** at **Location 3** and then delivers **Object 4** to **Location 4**.
- **Robot 3** utilizes both grippers to carry **Object 2** and **Object 7** from **Location 3**.
- **Robot 3** drops off **Object 7** at **Location 1** and delivers **Object 2** to **Location 4**.
- **Object 3** remains at **Location 3**, as it's already at its goal location.
- **Robot 2** remains idle or can be used for additional tasks if necessary, but involving it does not improve the plan's efficiency.

---

### **Total Actions:**

- **Robot 1:**

  - **Pick-up Actions:** 5
  - **Move Actions:** 4
  - **Drop-off Actions:** 4
  - **Total Actions:** **13**

- **Robot 3:**

  - **Pick-up Actions:** 2
  - **Move Actions:** 2
  - **Drop-off Actions:** 2
  - **Total Actions:** **6**

- **Overall Total Actions:** **19**

---

### **Final State:**

- **Object 1** is at **Location 1**.
- **Object 2** is at **Location 4**.
- **Object 3** remains at **Location 3**.
- **Object 4** is at **Location 4**.
- **Object 5** is at **Location 3**.
- **Object 6** is at **Location 2**.
- **Object 7** is at **Location 1**.
- All robots have empty grippers and are ready for new tasks.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This plan is optimal because it:

- **Maximizes efficiency** by utilizing both grippers on **Robots 1 and 3**, reducing the number of trips needed.
- **Minimizes total actions** by having robots carry multiple objects whenever possible.
- **Assigns tasks based on proximity**, reducing unnecessary movements.
- **Avoids idle time**, ensuring that robots are used effectively.

By following this sequence, all objects reach their destinations in the most efficient manner, satisfying all the conditions of the problem.
