Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to transport the `ujibqSzHx3H7` objects to their respective destinations using the defined actions. This plan leverages the capabilities of the two `h3saxs89ncG9` agents (`h3_1` and `h3_2`) to achieve the goal efficiently.

### **Plan Overview**

- **Agents:**
  - `h3_1`
  - `h3_2`

- **Objects:**
  - **Locations:** `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`, `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`, `tX2m4YtwPpHB_3`, `tX2m4YtwPpHB_4`, `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5`
  - **Transport Objects:** `ujibqSzHx3H7_1`, `ujibqSzHx3H7_2`
  - **Slots:** Each `h3saxs89ncG9` has two `gOfOcHaK497Z`, all initially free.

- **Actions:**
  1. **wfRWLzLXzkEl**: Load a `ujibqSzHx3H7` onto a `h3saxs89ncG9`.
  2. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm**: Move a `h3saxs89ncG9` from one location to another.
  3. **R2o0CTPiYQPT**: Unload a `ujibqSzHx3H7` from a `h3saxs89ncG9`.

### **Initial State**

- **Agents:**
  - `h3_1` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `h3_2` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.

- **Transport Objects:**
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` is in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

- **Slots:**
  - All `gOfOcHaK497Z` are free.

- **Goals:**
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` should be in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` should be in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_4`.

### **Optimal Plan**

Given that both `ujibqSzHx3H7` objects are initially in `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` and `h3_1` is already present at that location, the most efficient approach is to have `h3_1` handle both transports. This minimizes the number of actions by avoiding unnecessary movements by `h3_2`.

#### **Step-by-Step Actions**

   - **Agent:** `h3_1`
   - **Action:** `wfRWLzLXzkEl`
   - **Details:** Load `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` using the second free `gOfOcHaK497Z` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

3. **Move `h3_1` from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_1`
   - **Action:** `QUSgqkO2Ywrm`
   - **Details:** Transport from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5` while carrying `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` and `ujibqSzHx3H7_2`.

4. **Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` from `h3_1` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_1`
   - **Action:** `R2o0CTPiYQPT`
   - **Details:** Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5`.

5. **Move `h3_1` from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_4`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_1`
   - **Action:** `QUSgqkO2Ywrm`
   - **Details:** Transport from `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5` to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_4` while carrying `ujibqSzHx3H7_2`.

6. **Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` from `h3_1` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_4`**
   - **Agent:** `h3_1`
   - **Action:** `R2o0CTPiYQPT`
   - **Details:** Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_4`.

#### **Action Sequence Table**

| Step | Agent  | Action             | Details                                        |
|------|--------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | h3_1   | wfRWLzLXzkEl       | Load `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`      |
| 2    | h3_1   | wfRWLzLXzkEl       | Load `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`      |
| 3    | h3_1   | QUSgqkO2Ywrm       | Move to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5`                       |
| 4    | h3_1   | R2o0CTPiYQPT       | Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5`    |
| 5    | h3_1   | QUSgqkO2Ywrm       | Move to `tX2m4YtwPpHB_4`                       |
| 6    | h3_1   | R2o0CTPiYQPT       | Unload `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_4`    |

### **Summary of the Plan**

- **Total Actions:** 6
- **Agent Utilization:**
  - **`h3_1`:** Handles both loading and transporting tasks, minimizing the total number of actions.
  - **`h3_2`:** Remains idle, as involving `h3_2` would increase the total number of actions without providing any efficiency benefits in this specific scenario.

### **Final State**

- `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_5`.
- `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_4`.
- Both `h3_1` and `h3_2` are free, with `h3_1` located at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_4` and `h3_2` remaining at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.

This plan ensures that both `ujibqSzHx3H7` objects are transported to their respective destinations in the minimal number of actions by effectively utilizing the available agent.
