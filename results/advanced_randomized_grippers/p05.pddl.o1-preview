To solve this planning problem optimally, I'll first clarify the terminology and then provide the sequence of actions to achieve your goal.

**Terminology Deciphered:**

- **h3saxs89ncG9**: **Robot**
- **gOfOcHaK497Z**: **Gripper**
- **QUSgqkO2Ywrm**: **Move**
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB**: **Location**
- **RmkNTPUk7STW**: **At**
- **W4jJaSfDJP72**: **Not at**
- **ujibqSzHx3H7**: **Object**
- **wfRWLzLXzkEl**: **Pick-up**
- **J8xN6H9Yepyh**: **Empty gripper**
- **nszdIOOHZNQ8**: **Full gripper**
- **JNc8qalbbQ0o**: **Holding an object**
- **R2o0CTPiYQPT**: **Drop-off**
- **iyK2OXlGaPYz**: **Not holding an object**

---

**Initial State:**

- **Robots:**
  - **Robot 1** is at **Location 2**.
  - **Robot 2** is at **Location 1**.
- **Objects:**
  - **Object 1** is at **Location 1**; needs to remain at **Location 1**.
  - **Object 2** is at **Location 1**; needs to remain at **Location 1**.
  - **Object 3** is at **Location 1**; needs to be moved to **Location 2**.
  - **Object 4** is at **Location 1**; needs to remain at **Location 1**.
  - **Object 5** is at **Location 1**; needs to remain at **Location 1**.
- **Grippers:** All grippers are free (empty).

---

**Goal:**

- **Transport Object 3** from **Location 1** to **Location 2**.
- All other objects are already at their desired locations.

---

**Optimal Plan:**

Since **Robot 2** is already at **Location 1**, it can efficiently transport **Object 3** to **Location 2**.

**Sequence of Actions:**

1. **Pick Up Object 3 at Location 1:**

   - Action: `wfRWLzLXzkEl(Robot2, Object3, Location1, GripperA)`
     - **Robot 2** uses **Gripper A** to pick up **Object 3**.
     - **Gripper A** changes from **Empty** to **Full**.
     - **Robot 2** is now **Holding an object**.
     - **Object 3** is **Not at** **Location 1**.

2. **Move Robot 2 from Location 1 to Location 2:**

   - Action: `QUSgqkO2Ywrm(Robot2, Location1, Location2)`
     - **Robot 2** moves to **Location 2**.
     - **Robot 2** is now **At** **Location 2**.
     - **Robot 2** is **Not at** **Location 1**.

3. **Drop Off Object 3 at Location 2:**

   - Action: `R2o0CTPiYQPT(Robot2, Object3, Location2, GripperA)`
     - **Robot 2** releases **Object 3** at **Location 2**.
     - **Gripper A** changes from **Full** back to **Empty**.
     - **Robot 2** is now **Not holding an object**.
     - **Object 3** is now **At** **Location 2**.

---

**Explanation:**

- **Robot 2** efficiently completes the task with minimal actions:
  - **1 Pick-up**, **1 Move**, and **1 Drop-off**.
- **Robot 1** remains idle since it's not needed for this task.
- All other objects are already at their desired locations and require no action.

---

**Final State:**

- **Object 1** remains at **Location 1**.
- **Object 2** remains at **Location 1**.
- **Object 3** is now at **Location 2**.
- **Object 4** remains at **Location 1**.
- **Object 5** remains at **Location 1**.
- Both robots have their grippers empty and are not holding any objects.

---

**Conclusion:**

This plan is optimal because it:

- **Minimizes the number of actions** by using the closest robot to the object.
- **Utilizes resources efficiently**, involving only one robot and one gripper.
- **Avoids unnecessary movements** or idle time for other robots.

By following this sequence, **Object 3** is successfully transported to **Location 2**, and all goals are achieved in the most efficient manner.
