To solve this planning problem, we will coordinate the movement and actions of the three h3saxs89ncG9 agents to efficiently transport the ujibqSzHx3H7 items to their respective destinations across two tX2m4YtwPpHB locations. The goal is to minimize the total number of movements while ensuring all ujibqSzHx3H7s are correctly relocated.

### Initial Setup
- **Agents:**
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_1** and **h3saxs89ncG9_2** are in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**.
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_3** is in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.
- **Items:**
  - All ujibqSzHx3H7s (1, 2, 3, 4) are currently in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.

### Goal Destinations
- **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** stays in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.
- **ujibqSzHx3H7_2**, **ujibqSzHx3H7_3**, and **ujibqSzHx3H7_4** need to be moved to **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**.

### Optimal Plan Sequence

#### Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_3 (Currently in tX2m4YtwPpHB_2)
1. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_2**.
2. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 also loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_3**.
3. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_2 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_1 with **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_3**.
4. **R2o0CTPiYQPT (Unload)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 unloads both **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_1.

#### Additional Actions Needed for ujibqSzHx3H7_4
5. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 returns to tX2m4YtwPpHB_2.
6. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_4** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_2.
7. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_2 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_1 with **ujibqSzHx3H7_4**.
8. **R2o0CTPiYQPT (Unload)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 unloads **ujibqSzHx3H7_4** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_1.

#### Roles of h3saxs89ncG9_1 and h3saxs89ncG9_2 (Both Initially in tX2m4YtwPpHB_1)
- Both h3saxs89ncG9_1 and h3saxs89ncG9_2 can assist in unloading or remain on standby unless needed for any contingency during the transfers, such as congestion or timing issues.

### Final State Achieved
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**: Now contains **ujibqSzHx3H7_2**, **ujibqSzHx3H7_3**, and **ujibqSzHx3H7_4**.
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**: Now contains **ujibqSzHx3H7_1**.

This plan effectively utilizes h3saxs89ncG9_3's proximity to initially load and move the majority of the ujibqSzHx3H7s, ensuring efficient use of time and resources while minimizing the operational overhead for the other agents.
