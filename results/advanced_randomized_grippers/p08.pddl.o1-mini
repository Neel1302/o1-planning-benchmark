### **Summary of the Plan**

- **Total Actions:** 9

- **Agent Utilization:**
  - **`h3_1`:** Handles the transportation of `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` and `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` simultaneously.
  - **`h3_3`:** Handles the transportation of `ujibqSzHx3H7_4`.
  - **`h3_2`:** Handles the transportation of `ujibqSzHx3H7_3`.

- **Efficiency Considerations:**
  - **Parallel Processing:** Multiple agents perform actions concurrently where possible.
  - **Maximized Capacity Usage:** `h3_1` utilizes both `gOfOcHaK497Z` slots to transport two objects in a single trip.
  - **Minimal Movements:** Agents only move when necessary to minimize the total number of actions.

---

### **Final State**

- **Transport Objects:**
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_1` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_3` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_4` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `ujibqSzHx3H7_5` remains at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1` (already in destination).

- **Agents:**
  - `h3_1` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.
  - `h3_2` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_2`.
  - `h3_3` is at `tX2m4YtwPpHB_1`.

---

### **Rationale for Optimality**

- **Minimized Actions:** By allowing `h3_1` to carry two objects simultaneously, we reduce the total number of actions compared to handling each object individually.

- **Parallel Processing:** Utilizing `h3_3` and `h3_2` concurrently ensures that multiple transports occur in parallel, enhancing efficiency.

- **Efficient Agent Usage:** Each agent is assigned tasks that maximize their capacity and minimize unnecessary movements.

This plan ensures that all `ujibqSzHx3H7` objects are transported to their respective destinations in the minimal number of actions by effectively utilizing the available agents and their capacities.
