To effectively manage the transportation of the ujibqSzHx3H7 items between two tX2m4YtwPpHB locations using three h3saxs89ncG9 agents, we need to optimize the moves and actions of these agents. Below is a plan detailing the most efficient sequence of moves and actions to achieve the specified goal.

### Initial Setup
- **Agents:**
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_1** and **h3saxs89ncG9_3** are in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.
  - **h3saxs89ncG9_2** is in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**.

- **Items:**
  - **ujibqSzHx3H7_4**, **ujibqSzHx3H7_2**, and **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** are initially in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.
  - **ujibqSzHx3H7_5** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** are initially in **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**.

### Goal Destinations
- **ujibqSzHx3H7_1**, **ujibqSzHx3H7_2**, **ujibqSzHx3H7_4**, and **ujibqSzHx3H7_5** should be moved to **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1**.
- **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** should be moved to **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2**.

### Optimal Plan Sequence

#### Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_1 (Stationed at tX2m4YtwPpHB_2)
1. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_2.
2. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 also loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_2.
3. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_2 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_1 with **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_2**.
4. **R2o0CTPiYQPT (Unload)**: h3saxs89ncG9_1 unloads **ujibqSzHx3H7_1** and **ujibqSzHx3H7_2** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_1.

#### Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_2 (Initially in tX2m4YtwPpHB_1)
5. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_2 loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_5** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_1.
6. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_2 remains in tX2m4YtwPpHB_1 as all required ujibqSzHx3H7 are at their destination except for unloading.

#### Actions by h3saxs89ncG9_3 (Stationed at tX2m4YtwPpHB_2)
7. **wfRWLzLXzkEl (Load)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 loads **ujibqSzHx3H7_4** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_2.
8. **QUSgqkO2Ywrm (Move)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 moves from tX2m4YtwPpHB_2 to tX2m4YtwPpHB_1 with **ujibqSzHx3H7_4**.
9. **R2o0CTPiYQPT (Unload)**: h3saxs89ncG9_3 unloads **ujibqSzHx3H7_4** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_1.

#### Additional Step
10. **h3saxs89ncG9_2** unloads **ujibqSzHx3H7_5** at tX2m4YtwPpHB_1 (Completing the goal).

### Final State Achieved
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB_1** now contains **ujibqSzHx3H7_1**, **ujibqSzHx3H7_2**, **ujibqSzHx3H7_4**, and **ujibqSzHx3H7_5**.
- **tX2m4YtwPpHB_2** retains **ujibqSzHx3H7_3** as desired.

This plan ensures that all ujibqSzHx3H7 items are transported efficiently to their correct destinations with minimal movements and efficient use of the h3saxs89ncG9 agents' capabilities.
