Yes, here's an optimal plan to solve the problem using the actions established:

1. "lift" action: hoist0 lifts crate0 from container-0-0;
2. "go-out" action: hoist0 moves from container-0-0 to loadarea;
3. "go-in" action: hoist0 moves from loadarea to depot48-2-1;
4. "drop" action: hoist0 drops crate0 onto depot48-2-1;
5. "go-out" action: hoist0 moves from depot48-2-1 to loadarea;
6. "go-in" action: hoist0 moves from loadarea to container-0-1;
7. "lift" action: hoist0 lifts crate1 from container-0-1;
8. "go-out" action: hoist0 moves from container-0-1 to loadarea;
9. "go-in" action: hoist0 moves from loadarea to depot48-1-2;
10. "drop" action: hoist0 drops crate1 onto depot48-1-2;

By taking this sequence of actions, both crate0 and crate1 are moved to the depot48 which was the goal.
