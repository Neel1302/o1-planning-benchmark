To solve this problem optimally, we need to transport the single crate, `crate0`, from the container store area `container-0-0` in `container0` to a store area in `depot48`. We'll utilize hoist `hoist0`, initially located at `depot48-1-1`. Here is the step-by-step plan:

**Plan:**

1. **Move hoist0 from depot48-1-1 to loadarea:**
   - **Action:** `move(hoist0, depot48-1-1, loadarea)`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `hoist0` is at `depot48-1-1` (True)
     - `loadarea` is clear (True; no hoist or crate is in `loadarea`)
     - `depot48-1-1` and `loadarea` are connected (True)
   - **Effects:**
     - `hoist0` is removed from `depot48-1-1`
     - `hoist0` is placed in `loadarea`
     - `depot48-1-1` becomes clear
     - `loadarea` becomes occupied by `hoist0`

2. **Lift crate0 from container-0-0 while hoist0 is at loadarea:**
   - **Action:** `lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, loadarea, container0)`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `hoist0` is available (True)
     - `hoist0` is at `loadarea` (True)
     - `crate0` is on `container-0-0` (True)
     - `container-0-0` is in `container0` (True)
     - `container-0-0` and `loadarea` are connected (True; all container store areas are connected to `loadarea`)
   - **Effects:**
     - `crate0` is removed from `container-0-0`
     - `container-0-0` becomes clear
     - `hoist0` becomes unavailable
     - `hoist0` starts lifting `crate0`
     - `crate0` is removed from `container0`

3. **Move hoist0 (while lifting crate0) from loadarea back to depot48-1-1:**
   - **Action:** `move(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-1)`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `hoist0` is at `loadarea` (True)
     - `depot48-1-1` is clear (True; from step 1)
     - `loadarea` and `depot48-1-1` are connected (True)
   - **Effects:**
     - `hoist0` is removed from `loadarea`
     - `hoist0` is placed in `depot48-1-1`
     - `loadarea` becomes clear
     - `depot48-1-1` becomes occupied by `hoist0` (lifting `crate0`)

4. **Drop crate0 at depot48-1-1:**
   - **Action:** `drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-1, depot48-1-1, depot48)`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `hoist0` is at `depot48-1-1` (True)
     - `hoist0` is lifting `crate0` (True)
     - `depot48-1-1` is clear of other crates (True; only `hoist0` is there)
     - `depot48-1-1` is in `depot48` (True)
   - **Effects:**
     - `hoist0` stops lifting `crate0` and becomes available
     - `crate0` is placed in `depot48-1-1`
     - `depot48-1-1` becomes occupied by `crate0`

**Final State:**

- `crate0` is in `depot48-1-1`, which is in `depot48`.
- All crates are now in `depot48`, satisfying the goal.
- `hoist0` is at `depot48-1-1` and is available.
- `hoist1` remains at `depot48-1-2`.

This plan uses the minimal number of actions (four) required to move the crate from the container to the depot, making it optimal under the given action definitions and constraints.

**Optimal Plan:**

1. `move(hoist0, depot48-1-1, loadarea)`
2. `lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, loadarea, container0)`
3. `move(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-1)`
4. `drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-1, depot48-1-1, depot48)`
