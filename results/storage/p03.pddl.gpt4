Based on the given situation and the actions available with their preconditions and effects, let us consider the following optimal sequence of actions to move all the crates to the depot:

Note: Hoists could be used in parallel, but to ease the explanation, I've adopted a single route process.

1. "Move" action using hoist0: Move the hoist from depot48-1-2 to depot48-1-1.
2. "Go-out" action using hoist0: Move the hoist from depot48-1-1 to loadarea.
3. "Lift" action using hoist0: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 to hoist0.
4. "Go-in" action using hoist0: Move hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-1-1.
5. "Drop" action using hoist0: Drop crate0 from hoist0 to depot48-1-1.
6. "Move" action using hoist0: Move hoist0 from depot48-1-1 to depot48-1-2, so that it is ready for the next crate.

With this plan, we would have safely and efficiently moved the crate from the container to the depot. The exact sequence of steps may vary based on the specific details, but in general, this is an optimal sequence of steps to move all crates to the depot. Please note that hoists operation could be done in parallel if the goal is to minimize the total time spent.

Please note, the "go-in" and "go-out" actions are used to take the hoist in/out of the load area from/to the depot. Also note that the "move" action is used to move the hoist about within the depot. This ensures the hoist's availability at the required locations.
