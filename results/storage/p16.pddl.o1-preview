Yes, here's an optimal plan to move all crates to depot48:

1. **go-out hoist0 depot48-2-2 loadarea**

   - **Action:** hoist0 moves from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is in depot48-2-2.
     - depot48-2-2 and loadarea are connected.
   - **Effects:**
     - hoist0 is in loadarea.
     - depot48-2-2 becomes clear.

2. **lift hoist0 crate0 container-0-0 loadarea container0**

   - **Action:** hoist0 lifts crate0 from container-0-0 while in loadarea.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is available.
     - hoist0 is at loadarea.
     - crate0 is on container-0-0 in container0.
     - container-0-0 is connected to loadarea.
   - **Effects:**
     - crate0 is removed from container-0-0.
     - container-0-0 becomes clear.
     - hoist0 is now lifting crate0.
     - hoist0 becomes unavailable.
     - crate0 is no longer in container0.

3. **go-in hoist0 loadarea depot48-2-2**

   - **Action:** hoist0 moves from loadarea back to depot48-2-2.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is in loadarea.
     - loadarea and depot48-2-2 are connected.
     - depot48-2-2 is clear.
   - **Effects:**
     - hoist0 is in depot48-2-2.
     - depot48-2-2 becomes occupied.

4. **drop hoist0 crate0 depot48-2-1**

   - **Action:** hoist0 drops crate0 into depot48-2-1 from depot48-2-2.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is at depot48-2-2.
     - hoist0 is lifting crate0.
     - depot48-2-1 is clear.
     - depot48-2-1 is connected to depot48-2-2.
   - **Effects:**
     - crate0 is now in depot48-2-1.
     - depot48-2-1 becomes occupied by crate0.
     - hoist0 is no longer lifting crate0.
     - hoist0 becomes available.

5. **go-out hoist0 depot48-2-2 loadarea**

   - **Action:** hoist0 moves from depot48-2-2 to loadarea again.
   - **Preconditions and Effects:** Same as step 1.

6. **lift hoist0 crate1 container-0-1 loadarea container0**

   - **Action:** hoist0 lifts crate1 from container-0-1 while in loadarea.
   - **Preconditions and Effects:** Similar to step 2, but with crate1 and container-0-1.

7. **go-in hoist0 loadarea depot48-2-2**

   - **Action:** hoist0 returns to depot48-2-2 with crate1.
   - **Preconditions and Effects:** Same as step 3.

8. **drop hoist0 crate1 depot48-1-2**

   - **Action:** hoist0 drops crate1 into depot48-1-2 from depot48-2-2.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is at depot48-2-2.
     - hoist0 is lifting crate1.
     - depot48-1-2 is clear.
     - depot48-1-2 is connected to depot48-2-2.
   - **Effects:**
     - crate1 is now in depot48-1-2.
     - depot48-1-2 becomes occupied by crate1.
     - hoist0 is no longer lifting crate1.
     - hoist0 becomes available.

By following these steps, both crates are moved from the container areas to depot48 using hoist0 efficiently. This plan minimizes the number of actions by utilizing hoist0's proximity to loadarea and handling both crates sequentially.
