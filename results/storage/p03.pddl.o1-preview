To solve the problem of moving crate0 from container0 to depot48 using the available hoists and areas, we need to carefully plan a sequence of actions that adhere to the preconditions and effects of the actions described. Here's an optimal plan that accomplishes the goal:

**Initial State:**
- **Crates and Areas:**
  - crate0 is on container-0-0 (which is in container0).
  - container-0-0 is connected to loadarea.
  - depot48-1-2 and loadarea are connected.
- **Hoists:**
  - hoist0 is in depot48-1-2.
  - All hoists are available.

**Objective:**
- Move crate0 to depot48.

**Plan:**

1. **Action:** `go-out(hoist0, depot48-1-2, loadarea)`
   - **Description:** Hoist0 moves from depot48-1-2 to loadarea.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is in depot48-1-2.
     - depot48-1-2 and loadarea are connected.
   - **Effects:**
     - hoist0 is no longer in depot48-1-2.
     - hoist0 is now in loadarea.
     - depot48-1-2 becomes clear.

2. **Action:** `lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, container0, loadarea)`
   - **Description:** Hoist0 lifts crate0 from container-0-0 while at loadarea.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is available.
     - hoist0 is at loadarea.
     - crate0 is on container-0-0.
     - container-0-0 is connected to loadarea.
   - **Effects:**
     - crate0 is removed from container-0-0.
     - container-0-0 becomes clear.
     - hoist0 becomes unavailable (as it is now carrying crate0).
     - hoist0 is lifting crate0.
     - crate0 is no longer in container0.

3. **Action:** `go-in(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-2)`
   - **Description:** Hoist0 moves back into depot48-1-2 while carrying crate0.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is in loadarea.
     - loadarea and depot48-1-2 are connected.
     - depot48-1-2 is clear (since hoist0 left it in step 1).
   - **Effects:**
     - hoist0 is no longer in loadarea.
     - hoist0 is now in depot48-1-2.
     - depot48-1-2 becomes occupied by hoist0 (carrying crate0).

4. **Action:** `drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-2, depot48)`
   - **Description:** Hoist0 drops crate0 in depot48-1-2 which is part of depot48.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is at depot48-1-2.
     - hoist0 is lifting crate0.
     - depot48-1-2 is in depot48.
   - **Effects:**
     - hoist0 is no longer lifting crate0.
     - hoist0 becomes available.
     - crate0 is placed in depot48-1-2.
     - depot48-1-2 is occupied by crate0 (and hoist0).

**Outcome:**
- **Goal Achieved:** crate0 is now in depot48.

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1:** We move hoist0 out of depot48-1-2 to loadarea to prepare for lifting crate0.
- **Step 2:** Hoist0 lifts crate0 from container-0-0 while at loadarea because loadarea is connected to container-0-0.
- **Step 3:** Hoist0 moves back into depot48-1-2 carrying crate0. Since hoist0 left depot48-1-2 in Step 1, it is clear for re-entry.
- **Step 4:** Hoist0 drops crate0 in depot48-1-2, completing the task of moving crate0 to depot48.

This plan is optimal because it accomplishes the goal in the minimal number of steps required, utilizing the available hoist (hoist0) and the connections between areas without unnecessary movements or actions.

**Optimal Sequence of Actions:**

1. **go-out(hoist0, depot48-1-2, loadarea)**
2. **lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, container0, loadarea)**
3. **go-in(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-2)**
4. **drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-2, depot48)**
