Yes, I can provide an optimal plan to move all crates (in this case, just **crate0**) to **depot48**. Below is the sequence of actions required to achieve this goal:

### Initial State Summary:

- **Crate0** is on **container-0-0** in **container0**.
- **Hoist2** is at **depot48-1-2** and is available.
- **Container-0-0** and **depot48-1-2** are connected via **loadarea**.
- **Hoist2** can traverse between **depot48-1-2**, **loadarea**, and **container-0-0**.

### Optimal Plan:

1. **Go-Out**: Move **hoist2** from **depot48-1-2** to **loadarea**.
   - **Action**: `go-out(hoist2, depot48-1-2, loadarea)`
   - **Rationale**: Move hoist2 to the transit area (loadarea) connected to its current location.

2. **Go-In**: Move **hoist2** from **loadarea** into **container-0-0**.
   - **Action**: `go-in(hoist2, loadarea, container-0-0)`
   - **Rationale**: Enter the container store area where **crate0** is located.

3. **Lift**: Use **hoist2** to lift **crate0** at **container-0-0**.
   - **Action**: `lift(hoist2, crate0, container-0-0, container0)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - **Hoist2** is available and at **container-0-0**.
     - **Crate0** is on the surface in **container-0-0**.
     - **Container-0-0** is in **container0**.
   - **Effects**:
     - **Crate0** is removed from **container-0-0**.
     - **Hoist2** becomes unavailable (since it's lifting **crate0**).
     - **Crate0** is now being carried by **hoist2**.

4. **Go-Out**: Move **hoist2** (carrying **crate0**) from **container-0-0** back to **loadarea**.
   - **Action**: `go-out(hoist2, container-0-0, loadarea)`
   - **Rationale**: Exit the container area to transit towards the depot.

5. **Go-In**: Move **hoist2** (carrying **crate0**) from **loadarea** into **depot48-1-2**.
   - **Action**: `go-in(hoist2, loadarea, depot48-1-2)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - **Hoist2** is in **loadarea**.
     - **Loadarea** and **depot48-1-2** are connected.
     - **Depot48-1-2** is clear (no crates).
   - **Effects**:
     - **Hoist2** is now in **depot48-1-2**.
     - **Depot48-1-2** is occupied by **hoist2**.

6. **Drop**: Use **hoist2** to drop **crate0** at **depot48-1-2**.
   - **Action**: `drop(hoist2, crate0, depot48-1-2, depot48)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - **Hoist2** is at **depot48-1-2**.
     - **Hoist2** is lifting **crate0**.
     - **Depot48-1-2** is clear of other crates.
     - **Depot48-1-2** is in **depot48**.
   - **Effects**:
     - **Crate0** is placed in **depot48-1-2**.
     - **Hoist2** becomes available again.
     - **Depot48-1-2** is now occupied by **crate0**.

### Plan Summary:

By following these steps, **crate0** is successfully moved from **container0** to **depot48**, achieving the goal. This plan is optimal because it uses the shortest possible sequence of actions with the available hoist (**hoist2**) and the defined domain actions.

### Note on Preconditions and Effects:

- The terms **"clear"** and **"occupied"** refer primarily to the presence of crates, not hoists. A store area is considered clear if there are no crates on the surface, even if a hoist is present.
- Hoists can carry crates while performing **go-in** and **go-out** actions unless explicitly restricted, which is not the case in the provided action definitions.
- The **drop** action requires the destination store area to be clear of other crates to avoid stacking conflicts.

### Conclusion:

This sequence efficiently utilizes the connections between areas and the capabilities of **hoist2** to transport **crate0** to **depot48**. All actions adhere to the specified preconditions and effects, ensuring a valid and optimal solution to the planning problem.
