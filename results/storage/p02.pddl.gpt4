1. Use hoist0 to execute the "go-out" action from depot48-1-1 to loadarea.
2. Then, execute the "go-in" action from loadarea to container-0-0.
3. Execute the "lift" action to lift crate0 from container-0-0 to hoist0.
4. After crate0 is lifted, execute the "go-out" action to move hoist0 (carrying crate0) from container-0-0 to loadarea.
5. Then, execute the "go-in" action from loadarea to depot48-1-1.
6. Finally, execute the "drop" action to drop crate0 from hoist0 onto the surface in depot48-1-1.

This sequence of behaviors will successfully move crate0 from container-0-0 to depot48-1-1, therefore satisfying the goal of moving all crates to depot48. The plan assumes that at any given time, a hoist can only lift one crate, and that it does not need to be available to move between areas when it is lifting a crate.
