   - **Effects**:
     - hoist2 (lifting crate0) is now in depot48-2-2.
     - depot48-2-1 becomes clear.
     - depot48-2-2 becomes occupied by hoist2.

6. **Hoist2 drops crate0 in depot48-2-2**:
   - **Action**: `drop(hoist2, crate0, depot48-2-2, depot48-2-2, depot48)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - hoist2 is at depot48-2-2.
     - hoist2 is lifting crate0.
     - depot48-2-2 is occupied by hoist2 (but can still drop).
     - depot48-2-2 is in depot48.
   - **Effects**:
     - hoist2 is now available.
     - hoist2 is still in depot48-2-2.
     - depot48-2-2 is occupied by crate0.

7. **Hoist2 moves back to depot48-2-1**:
   - **Action**: `move(hoist2, depot48-2-2, depot48-2-1)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - hoist2 is in depot48-2-2.
     - depot48-2-1 is clear.
     - depot48-2-2 and depot48-2-1 are connected.
   - **Effects**:
     - hoist2 is now in depot48-2-1.
     - depot48-2-2 remains occupied by crate0.
     - depot48-2-1 becomes occupied by hoist2.

8. **Hoist2 goes out from depot48-2-1 to loadarea**:
   - **Action**: `go-out(hoist2, depot48-2-1, loadarea)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - hoist2 is in depot48-2-1.
     - depot48-2-1 and loadarea are connected.
   - **Effects**:
     - hoist2 is now in loadarea.
     - depot48-2-1 becomes clear.

9. **Hoist2 lifts crate1 from container-0-1 while at loadarea**:
   - **Action**: `lift(hoist2, crate1, container-0-1, loadarea, container0)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - hoist2 is available.
     - hoist2 is at loadarea.
     - crate1 is on container-0-1.
     - container-0-1 is in container0.
   - **Effects**:
     - hoist2 is now lifting crate1.
     - hoist2 becomes unavailable.
     - container-0-1 becomes clear.
     - crate1 is removed from container0.

10. **Hoist2 goes into depot48-2-1 with crate1**:
    - **Action**: `go-in(hoist2, loadarea, depot48-2-1)`
    - **Preconditions**:
      - hoist2 (lifting crate1) is in loadarea.
      - loadarea and depot48-2-1 are connected.
      - depot48-2-1 is clear.
    - **Effects**:
      - hoist2 (lifting crate1) is now in depot48-2-1.
      - depot48-2-1 becomes occupied by hoist2.

11. **Hoist2 drops crate1 in depot48-2-1**:
    - **Action**: `drop(hoist2, crate1, depot48-2-1, depot48-2-1, depot48)`
    - **Preconditions**:
      - hoist2 is at depot48-2-1.
      - hoist2 is lifting crate1.
      - depot48-2-1 is occupied by hoist2 (but can still drop).
      - depot48-2-1 is in depot48.
    - **Effects**:
      - hoist2 is now available.
      - hoist2 is still in depot48-2-1.
      - depot48-2-1 is occupied by crate1.

**Summary**: The plan efficiently uses hoist2 to move both crates from the container storeareas to depot48. Crate0 is placed in depot48-2-2, and crate1 is placed in depot48-2-1. The plan uses the available connections and obeys all the preconditions and effects of the actions, achieving the goal in an optimal way.
