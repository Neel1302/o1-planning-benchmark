Yes, here is an optimal plan to move all crates (in this case, crate0) to depot48:

1. **Action:** `go-out(hoist0, depot48-1-1, loadarea)`
   - **Description:** Move hoist0 from the store area `depot48-1-1` to the transit area `loadarea`.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is in `depot48-1-1`.
     - `depot48-1-1` and `loadarea` are connected.
   - **Effects:**
     - hoist0 is now in `loadarea`.
     - `depot48-1-1` becomes clear.

2. **Action:** `lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, loadarea, container0)`
   - **Description:** Using hoist0 at `loadarea`, lift crate0 from the container store area `container-0-0`.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is available.
     - hoist0 is at `loadarea`.
     - crate0 is on `container-0-0`.
     - `container-0-0` is connected to `loadarea`.
     - `container-0-0` is in `container0`.
   - **Effects:**
     - crate0 is no longer on `container-0-0`.
     - `container-0-0` becomes clear.
     - hoist0 is now lifting crate0 (hoist0 becomes unavailable).
     - crate0 is no longer in `container0`.

3. **Action:** `go-in(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-1)`
   - **Description:** Move hoist0 (lifting crate0) from the transit area `loadarea` back into the store area `depot48-1-1`.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is in `loadarea`.
     - `loadarea` and `depot48-1-1` are connected.
     - `depot48-1-1` is clear (from the first action).
   - **Effects:**
     - hoist0 is now in `depot48-1-1`.
     - `depot48-1-1` becomes occupied (by hoist0 lifting crate0).

4. **Action:** `drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-1, depot48)`
   - **Description:** At `depot48-1-1`, drop crate0 from hoist0.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - hoist0 is at `depot48-1-1`.
     - hoist0 is lifting crate0.
     - `depot48-1-1` is clear of other crates.
     - `depot48-1-1` is in `depot48`.
   - **Effects:**
     - hoist0 is no longer lifting crate0 (hoist0 becomes available).
     - crate0 is now on `depot48-1-1`.
     - crate0 is in `depot48-1-1`.

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1:** Moves the hoist to a position where it can access both the container store area and the depot store area.
- **Step 2:** Lifts the crate from the container store area using the hoist.
- **Step 3:** Brings the hoist (carrying the crate) into the depot store area.
- **Step 4:** Drops the crate in the depot store area, achieving the goal.

This plan moves crate0 from its initial position in `container0` to `depot48`, satisfying the goal of moving all crates to the depot. Each action follows the domain's preconditions and effects, ensuring a valid and optimal sequence.
