Here is an optimal sequence of actions to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" hoist0 from depot48-1-2 to loadarea.
2. "move" hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-0.
3. "lift" hoist0 from container-0-0 to crate0.
4. "go-out" hoist0 from container-0-0 to loadarea.
5. "move" hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
6. "drop" hoist0 with crate0 at depot48-2-1.
7. "go-out" hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
8. "move" hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-1.
9. "lift" hoist0 from container-0-1 to crate1.
10. "go-out" hoist0 from container-0-1 to loadarea.
11. "move" hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
12. "drop" hoist0 with crate1 at depot48-2-2.

Now all crates have been moved to depot48, thus accomplishing the goal.
