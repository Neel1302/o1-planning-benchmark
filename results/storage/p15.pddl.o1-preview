Yes, here is an optimal plan to move all crates to `depot48`:

1. **Move hoist0 from depot48-1-2 to depot48-1-1**  
   **Action**: `move`  
   **Preconditions**:
   - hoist0 is at depot48-1-2
   - depot48-1-1 is clear
   - depot48-1-2 and depot48-1-1 are connected
   **Effects**:
   - hoist0 is now at depot48-1-1
   - depot48-1-2 becomes clear
   - depot48-1-1 becomes occupied

2. **Move hoist0 from depot48-1-1 to depot48-2-1**  
   **Action**: `move`  
   **Preconditions**:
   - hoist0 is at depot48-1-1
   - depot48-2-1 is clear
   - depot48-1-1 and depot48-2-1 are connected
   **Effects**:
   - hoist0 is now at depot48-2-1
   - depot48-1-1 becomes clear
   - depot48-2-1 becomes occupied

3. **Go out hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea**  
   **Action**: `go-out`  
   **Preconditions**:
   - hoist0 is at depot48-2-1
   - depot48-2-1 and loadarea are connected
   **Effects**:
   - hoist0 is now at loadarea
   - depot48-2-1 becomes clear

4. **Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0 at loadarea**  
   **Action**: `lift`  
   **Preconditions**:
   - hoist0 is available
   - hoist0 is at loadarea
   - crate0 is on container-0-0
   - container-0-0 is connected to loadarea
   **Effects**:
   - hoist0 is lifting crate0
   - hoist0 becomes unavailable
   - crate0 is removed from container-0-0
   - container-0-0 becomes clear

5. **Go in hoist0 with crate0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1**  
   **Action**: `go-in`  
   **Preconditions**:
   - hoist0 is at loadarea
   - hoist0 is lifting crate0
   - loadarea and depot48-2-1 are connected
   - depot48-2-1 is clear
   **Effects**:
   - hoist0 is now at depot48-2-1
   - depot48-2-1 becomes occupied

6. **Drop crate0 at depot48-2-2 from hoist0 at depot48-2-1**  
   **Action**: `drop`  
   **Preconditions**:
   - hoist0 is at depot48-2-1
   - hoist0 is lifting crate0
   - depot48-2-2 is clear
   - depot48-2-2 is connected to depot48-2-1
   **Effects**:
   - hoist0 releases crate0
   - hoist0 becomes available
   - crate0 is now at depot48-2-2
   - depot48-2-2 becomes occupied

7. **Go out hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea**  
   **Action**: `go-out`  
   **Preconditions**:
   - hoist0 is at depot48-2-1
   - depot48-2-1 and loadarea are connected
   **Effects**:
   - hoist0 is now at loadarea
   - depot48-2-1 becomes clear

8. **Lift crate1 from container-0-1 using hoist0 at loadarea**  
   **Action**: `lift`  
   **Preconditions**:
   - hoist0 is available
   - hoist0 is at loadarea
   - crate1 is on container-0-1
   - container-0-1 is connected to loadarea
   **Effects**:
   - hoist0 is lifting crate1
   - hoist0 becomes unavailable
   - crate1 is removed from container-0-1
   - container-0-1 becomes clear

9. **Go in hoist0 with crate1 from loadarea to depot48-2-1**  
   **Action**: `go-in`  
   **Preconditions**:
   - hoist0 is at loadarea
   - hoist0 is lifting crate1
   - loadarea and depot48-2-1 are connected
   - depot48-2-1 is clear
   **Effects**:
   - hoist0 is now at depot48-2-1
   - depot48-2-1 becomes occupied

10. **Drop crate1 at depot48-1-1 from hoist0 at depot48-2-1**  
    **Action**: `drop`  
    **Preconditions**:
    - hoist0 is at depot48-2-1
    - hoist0 is lifting crate1
    - depot48-1-1 is clear
    - depot48-1-1 is connected to depot48-2-1
    **Effects**:
    - hoist0 releases crate1
    - hoist0 becomes available
    - crate1 is now at depot48-1-1
    - depot48-1-1 becomes occupied

This plan efficiently moves both crates from their initial positions in `container0` to `depot48`, fulfilling the goal. Each action follows the specified preconditions and effects, ensuring the hoist and crates are moved properly according to the domain rules.
