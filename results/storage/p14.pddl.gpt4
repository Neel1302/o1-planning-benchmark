Sure, to solve this problem, I suggest you follow the following steps:

1. Use the "lift" action with hoist2 at container-0-0 to lift crate0. After this action, hoist2 is lifting crate0, and container-0-0 is clear.

2. Use the "go-out" action with hoist2 from container-0-0 to loadarea. After this action, hoist2, lifting crate0, is in loadarea.

3. Use the "go-in" action with hoist2 from loadarea to depot48-1-2. After this action, hoist2, lifting crate0, is in depot48-1-2. 

4. Use the "drop" action with hoist2 at depot48-1-2 to drop crate0. After this action, hoist2 is available again, and depot48-1-2 is occupied by crate0.

5. Repeat similar actions if there are more crates in the container areas. But according to the given problem, all our crates are now in the depot, so the goal is reached!

In summary, the sequence of actions is:

- lift(hoist2, container-0-0, crate0)
- go-out(hoist2, container-0-0, loadarea)
- go-in(hoist2, loadarea, depot48-1-2)
- drop(hoist2, depot48-1-2, crate0)
