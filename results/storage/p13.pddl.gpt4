Yes, here is the optimal sequence of actions:

1. "lift" action: hoist0 lifts crate0 from container-0-0.
    - Parameters: hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, loadarea.
2. "go-out" action: hoist0 with crate0 goes out from container-0-0 to loadarea.
    - Parameters: hoist0, container-0-0, loadarea.
3. "move" action: hoist0 with crate0 moves from loadarea to depot48-1-2.
    - Parameters: hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-2.
4. "drop" action: hoist0 drops crate0 onto depot48-1-2.
    - Parameters: hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-2, depot48.

To validate this plan, you need to assure all actions' preconditions hold in each step, and the final state matches the goal state: all crates are in depot48.
