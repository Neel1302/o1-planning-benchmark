Based on the descriptions and conditions provided, here is an optimal plan to move all crates to depot48:

Step 1: Lift crate0 with hoist0
- 'lift' action - Parameters: hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, depot48-2-2

Step 2: Move hoist0 with crate0 to depot48-2-1
- 'move' action - Parameters: hoist0, depot48-2-2, depot48-2-1

Step 3: Drop crate0 with hoist0 at depot48-2-1
- 'drop' action - Parameters: hoist0, crate0, depot48-2-1

Step 4: Lift crate1 with hoist1
- 'lift' action - Parameters: hoist1, crate1, container-0-1, depot48-2-1

Step 5: Move hoist1 with crate1 to depot48-1-1
- 'move' action - Parameters: hoist1, depot48-2-1, depot48-1-1

Step 6: Drop crate1 with hoist1 at depot48-1-1
- 'drop' action - Parameters: hoist1, crate1, depot48-1-1

The above plan involves 6 steps, with 2 lifting operations, 2 moving operations, and 2 dropping operations. Each hoist handles one crate, reducing the amount of movement and thus increases the overall efficiency.
