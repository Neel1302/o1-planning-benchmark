Sure, let's provide an optimal plan as to how to move all the crates to depot48.

1. First, we "move" the hoist to the load area. The command would be "move(hoist0, depot48-1-1, loadarea)".

2. After the hoist is in the load area, we "go-in" to the container store area where the crate is located. The command would be "go-in(hoist0, loadarea, container-0-0)".

3. Once in the container store area, we "lift" the crate. The command would be "lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0)".

4. After lifting the crate, we "go-out" to the load area. The command would be "go-out(hoist0, container-0-0, loadarea)".

5. From the load area, we "move" to the depot store area (depot48-1-1). The command would be "move(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-1)".

6. Once at the depot store area, we "drop" the crate. The command would be "drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-1)".

With this plan, hoist0 lifts the crate from the container store area, moves out to the load area, moves into the depot store area, and then drops the crate in the depot store area. This sequence of actions satisfies the problem requirements, moving the crate to depot48.
