Certainly! Below is an **optimal sequence of actions** to move all crates to `depot48` using the available hoist and actions defined.

### **Action Sequence:**

1. **Move hoist0 from `depot48-1-2` to `depot48-2-2`**
   - **Action:** `move(hoist0, depot48-1-2, depot48-2-2)`
   - **Description:** Transport the hoist from its initial position to a connected depot area.

2. **Move hoist0 from `depot48-2-2` to `depot48-2-1`**
   - **Action:** `move(hoist0, depot48-2-2, depot48-2-1)`
   - **Description:** Continue moving the hoist closer to the `loadarea`.

3. **Move hoist0 from `depot48-2-1` to `loadarea`**
   - **Action:** `move(hoist0, depot48-2-1, loadarea)`
   - **Description:** Position the hoist at the `loadarea` to access the container store areas.

4. **Lift `crate0` from `container-0-0` using `hoist0`**
   - **Action:** `lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0)`
   - **Description:** Use the hoist to lift `crate0` from its current container location.

5. **Move hoist0 from `loadarea` to `depot48-2-1`**
   - **Action:** `move(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-2-1)`
   - **Description:** Transport the hoist (now holding `crate0`) back towards the depot area.

6. **Drop `crate0` at `depot48-2-1`**
   - **Action:** `drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-2-1)`
   - **Description:** Place `crate0` into the designated depot store area.

7. **Move hoist0 from `depot48-2-1` to `loadarea`**
   - **Action:** `move(hoist0, depot48-2-1, loadarea)`
   - **Description:** Return the hoist to the `loadarea` to handle the next crate.

8. **Lift `crate1` from `container-0-1` using `hoist0`**
   - **Action:** `lift(hoist0, crate1, container-0-1)`
   - **Description:** Use the hoist to lift `crate1` from its current container location.

9. **Move hoist0 from `loadarea` to `depot48-2-1`**
   - **Action:** `move(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-2-1)`
   - **Description:** Transport the hoist (now holding `crate1`) back towards the depot area.

10. **Drop `crate1` at `depot48-2-1`**
    - **Action:** `drop(hoist0, crate1, depot48-2-1)`
    - **Description:** Place `crate1` into the designated depot store area.

### **Summary:**

- **Total Actions:** 10
- **Hoist Path:**
  - **Initial Position:** `depot48-1-2`
  - **Final Position:** `depot48-2-1` (after dropping both crates)

### **Notes:**

- **Efficiency:** This sequence ensures the hoist takes the shortest possible path between locations, minimizing unnecessary movements.
- **Action Preconditions:** Each action respects the preconditions outlined for `move`, `lift`, and `drop` actions, ensuring feasibility at every step.
- **Depot Allocation:** Both crates are deposited in `depot48-2-1`, but they can be distributed across any of the depot store areas (`depot48-1-1`, `depot48-1-2`, `depot48-2-1`, `depot48-2-2`) based on specific depot organization preferences.

This plan ensures that both `crate0` and `crate1` are efficiently moved from their container locations to `depot48` with the minimal number of actions required.
