To solve this problem optimally, we need to move both crates from the container store areas to the depot store areas using the single hoist available. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Move hoist0 from `depot48-1-1` to `depot48-2-1`**  
   - **Action**: `move`  
   - **Preconditions**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` is in `depot48-1-1`.  
     - `depot48-2-1` is clear.  
     - `depot48-1-1` and `depot48-2-1` are connected.  
   - **Effects**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` moves to `depot48-2-1`.  
     - `depot48-1-1` becomes clear.  

2. **Go out from `depot48-2-1` to `loadarea`**  
   - **Action**: `go-out`  
   - **Preconditions**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` is in `depot48-2-1`.  
     - `depot48-2-1` and `loadarea` are connected.  
   - **Effects**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` moves to `loadarea`.  
     - `depot48-2-1` becomes clear.  

3. **Go into `container-0-0` from `loadarea`**  
   - **Action**: `go-in`  
   - **Preconditions**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` is in `loadarea`.  
     - `loadarea` and `container-0-0` are connected.  
     - `container-0-0` is not occupied by another hoist (assuming it can be entered even if a crate is present).  
   - **Effects**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` moves into `container-0-0`.  

4. **Lift `crate0` in `container-0-0`**  
   - **Action**: `lift`  
   - **Preconditions**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` is available.  
     - Hoist `hoist0` is at `container-0-0`.  
     - `crate0` is on the surface in `container-0-0`.  
     - `container-0-0` is in `container0`.  
   - **Effects**:  
     - `crate0` is removed from `container-0-0`.  
     - `container-0-0` becomes clear.  
     - Hoist `hoist0` becomes unavailable (it's lifting `crate0`).  

5. **Go out from `container-0-0` to `loadarea` with `crate0`**  
   - **Action**: `go-out`  
   - **Preconditions**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` (lifting `crate0`) is in `container-0-0`.  
     - `container-0-0` and `loadarea` are connected.  
   - **Effects**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` moves to `loadarea` with `crate0`.  
     - `container-0-0` becomes clear.  

6. **Go into `depot48-2-1` from `loadarea` with `crate0`**  
   - **Action**: `go-in`  
   - **Preconditions**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` (lifting `crate0`) is in `loadarea`.  
     - `loadarea` and `depot48-2-1` are connected.  
     - `depot48-2-1` is clear (no other crate present).  
   - **Effects**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` moves into `depot48-2-1` with `crate0`.  

7. **Drop `crate0` in `depot48-2-1`**  
   - **Action**: `drop`  
   - **Preconditions**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` is at `depot48-2-1`.  
     - Hoist `hoist0` is lifting `crate0`.  
     - `depot48-2-1` is clear of other crates.  
   - **Effects**:  
     - `crate0` is placed in `depot48-2-1`.  
     - Hoist `hoist0` becomes available.  

8. **Go out from `depot48-2-1` to `loadarea`**  
   - **Action**: `go-out`  
   - **Preconditions**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` is in `depot48-2-1`.  
     - `depot48-2-1` and `loadarea` are connected.  
   - **Effects**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` moves to `loadarea`.  
     - `depot48-2-1` remains with `crate0`.  

9. **Go into `container-0-1` from `loadarea`**  
   - **Action**: `go-in`  
   - **Preconditions**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` is in `loadarea`.  
     - `loadarea` and `container-0-1` are connected.  
     - `container-0-1` is not occupied by another hoist.  
   - **Effects**:  
     - Hoist `hoist0` moves into `container-0-1`.  

10. **Lift `crate1` in `container-0-1`**  
    - **Action**: `lift`  
    - **Preconditions**:  
      - Hoist `hoist0` is available.  
      - Hoist `hoist0` is at `container-0-1`.  
      - `crate1` is on the surface in `container-0-1`.  
      - `container-0-1` is in `container0`.  
    - **Effects**:  
      - `crate1` is removed from `container-0-1`.  
      - `container-0-1` becomes clear.  
      - Hoist `hoist0` becomes unavailable (it's lifting `crate1`).  

11. **Go out from `container-0-1` to `loadarea` with `crate1`**  
    - **Action**: `go-out`  
    - **Preconditions**:  
      - Hoist `hoist0` (lifting `crate1`) is in `container-0-1`.  
      - `container-0-1` and `loadarea` are connected.  
    - **Effects**:  
      - Hoist `hoist0` moves to `loadarea` with `crate1`.  
      - `container-0-1` becomes clear.  

12. **Go into `depot48-1-2` from `loadarea` with `crate1`**  
    - **Action**: `go-in`  
    - **Preconditions**:  
      - Hoist `hoist0` (lifting `crate1`) is in `loadarea`.  
      - `loadarea` and `depot48-1-2` are connected.  
      - `depot48-1-2` is clear.  
    - **Effects**:  
      - Hoist `hoist0` moves into `depot48-1-2` with `crate1`.  

13. **Drop `crate1` in `depot48-1-2`**  
    - **Action**: `drop`  
    - **Preconditions**:  
      - Hoist `hoist0` is at `depot48-1-2`.

      - `depot48-1-2` is clear of other crates.  
    - **Effects**:  
      - `crate1` is placed in `depot48-1-2`.  
      - Hoist `hoist0` becomes available.  

**Summary of the Plan:**

- **Total Actions**: 13 steps.
- **Crates Moved**: Both `crate0` and `crate1` are moved from the container store areas to the depot store areas within `depot48`.
- **Hoist Movements**: The hoist moves efficiently between areas, minimizing unnecessary steps and ensuring that it is available when needed.
  
This plan ensures that all crates are moved to `depot48` optimally, satisfying the goal conditions with the minimal necessary actions.
