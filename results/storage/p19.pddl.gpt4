Here is a possible optimal plan:

1. "Move" hoist1 from depot48-1-1 to depot48-1-2.
2. "Go-out" hoist1 from depot48-1-2 to loadarea.
3. "Lift" hoist1 to lift crate2 from container-0-2
4. "Go-in" hoist1 from loadarea to depot48-1-2.
5. "Drop" hoist1 to drop crate2 at depot48-1-2.
6. "Move" hoist1 from depot48-1-2 to depot48-1-3.
7. "Go-out" hoist1 from depot48-1-3 to loadarea.
8. "Lift" hoist1 to lift crate1 from container-0-1
9. "Go-in" hoist1 from loadarea to depot48-1-3.
10. "Drop" hoist1 to drop crate1 at depot48-1-3.

At this point, crate1 and crate2 are moved in depot48. 

We will now use hoist0 to move crate0:
11. "Move" hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to depot48-2-2.
12. "Go-out" hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
13. "Lift" hoist0 to lift crate0 from container-0-0
14. "Go-in" hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
15. "Drop" hoist0 to drop crate0 at depot48-2-2.

In this plan, all crates are moved from their container storeareas to the depot48 with minimal actions. This is optimal considering the preconditions and the effects of each action in the planning problem. Because, it is based on the shortest path and less use of actions to deliver the crates to their destination.
