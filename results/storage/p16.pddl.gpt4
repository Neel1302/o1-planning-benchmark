Certainly, here's an optimal plan for moving all crates to depot48:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist1 from depot48-1-1 to loadarea. 

2. "move" action: Move hoist1 from loadarea to container-0-0.

3. "lift" action: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist1.

4. "go-out" action: Move hoist1 carrying crate0 from container-0-0 to loadarea.

5. "move" action: Move hoist1 carrying crate0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.

6. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist1 onto depot48-2-1.

7. "go-out" action: Move hoist1 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea. 

8. "move" action: Move hoist1 from loadarea to container-0-1.

9. "lift" action: Lift crate1 from container-0-1 using hoist1.

10. "go-out" action: Move hoist1 carrying crate1 from container-0-1 to loadarea.

11. "move" action: Move hoist1 carrying crate1 from loadarea to depot48-1-2.

12. "drop" action: Drop crate1 from hoist1 onto depot48-1-2.

This plan represents the most optimal and efficient way to transport all crates from the containers to the depot with the given conditions.
