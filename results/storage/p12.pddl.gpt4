In order to solve the given problem, we should follow the sequence of actions or behaviors as outlined below:

1. **lift( hoist0, crate0, container-0-0 ):** Lift the crate from the container store area to the hoist using the "lift" action.

2. **go-out( hoist0, container-0-0, loadarea ):** Move hoist0 from the container store area to the transit area, i.e., loadarea using the "go-out" action.

3. **move( hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-1 ):** Move the hoist with the crate from the transit area to the depot store area using the "move" action.

4. **drop( hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-1 ):** At last, drop the crate from the hoist to the depot store area using the "drop" action.

Following this sequence of behaviors, the goal of moving all crates to depot48 can be achieved optimally. Please make sure that all preconditions for each action are satisfied before carrying out the action.
