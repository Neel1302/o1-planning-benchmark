To solve this problem efficiently, we'll use **hoist1** to transport both **crate0** and **crate1** from the container store areas to the depot store areas in **depot48**.

**Here is the optimal sequence of actions:**

1. **Go-out hoist1 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.**
   - *Action*: `go-out(hoist1, depot48-2-1, loadarea)`
   - *Explanation*: Move hoist1 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea. This makes depot48-2-1 clear.

2. **Lift crate0 from container-0-0 to loadarea using hoist1.**
   - *Action*: `lift(hoist1, crate0, container-0-0, loadarea, container0)`
   - *Preconditions*:
     - hoist1 is available.
     - hoist1 is at loadarea.
     - crate0 is on container-0-0.
     - container-0-0 is in container0.
   - *Effects*:
     - Remove crate0 from container-0-0.
     - container-0-0 becomes clear.
     - hoist1 becomes unavailable and is lifting crate0.
     - crate0 is no longer in container0.

3. **Go-in hoist1 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.**
   - *Action*: `go-in(hoist1, loadarea, depot48-2-1)`
   - *Preconditions*:
     - hoist1 is at loadarea.
     - loadarea and depot48-2-1 are connected.
     - depot48-2-1 is clear.
   - *Effects*:
     - hoist1 moves to depot48-2-1.
     - depot48-2-1 becomes occupied by hoist1.

4. **Drop crate0 onto depot48-1-1 from depot48-2-1 using hoist1.**
   - *Action*: `drop(hoist1, crate0, depot48-1-1, depot48-2-1, depot48)`
   - *Preconditions*:
     - hoist1 is at depot48-2-1.
     - hoist1 is lifting crate0.
     - depot48-1-1 is clear.
     - depot48-1-1 is in depot48.
   - *Effects*:
     - hoist1 is no longer lifting crate0 and becomes available.
     - depot48-1-1 becomes occupied by crate0.
     - crate0 is in depot48-1-1.

5. **Go-out hoist1 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.**
   - *Action*: `go-out(hoist1, depot48-2-1, loadarea)`
   - *Explanation*: Move hoist1 back to loadarea. Depot48-2-1 becomes clear.

6. **Lift crate1 from container-0-1 to loadarea using hoist1.**
   - *Action*: `lift(hoist1, crate1, container-0-1, loadarea, container0)`
   - *Preconditions*:
     - hoist1 is available.
     - hoist1 is at loadarea.
     - crate1 is on container-0-1.
     - container-0-1 is in container0.
   - *Effects*:
     - Remove crate1 from container-0-1.
     - container-0-1 becomes clear.
     - hoist1 becomes unavailable and is lifting crate1.
     - crate1 is no longer in container0.

7. **Drop crate1 onto depot48-2-1 from loadarea using hoist1.**
   - *Action*: `drop(hoist1, crate1, depot48-2-1, loadarea, depot48)`
   - *Preconditions*:
     - hoist1 is at loadarea.
     - hoist1 is lifting crate1.
     - depot48-2-1 is clear.
     - depot48-2-1 is in depot48.
   - *Effects*:
     - hoist1 is no longer lifting crate1 and becomes available.
     - depot48-2-1 becomes occupied by crate1.
     - crate1 is in depot48-2-1.

**Summary of the Plan:**

- **Steps 1-4**: Use hoist1 to move crate0 from container-0-0 to depot48-1-1.
- **Steps 5-7**: Use hoist1 to move crate1 from container-0-1 to depot48-2-1.

**This plan efficiently moves both crates to depot48 in 7 steps, satisfying the goal.**
