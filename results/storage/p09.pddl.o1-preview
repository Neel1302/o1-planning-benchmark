To solve this problem optimally, we'll use **Hoist0** to move all four crates from the container store areas in **container0** to the depot store areas in **depot48**. We'll move the crates one by one, utilizing clear depot store areas to place the crates. 

Here is the sequence of actions:

1. **Hoist0** performs **go-out** from **depot48-2-1** to **loadarea**.

    - *Preconditions*: Hoist0 is in **loadarea**; **depot48-2-3** is clear; **loadarea** and **depot48-2-3** are connected via depot areas.
    - *Effects*: Hoist0 is now in **depot48-2-3**; **depot48-2-3** becomes occupied by Hoist0.

12. **Hoist0** performs **drop** to place **crate2** in **depot48-2-3**.
    - *Preconditions*: Hoist0 is at **depot48-2-3**; Hoist0 is lifting **crate2**; **depot48-2-3** is clear of crates.
    - *Effects*: Hoist0 releases **crate2**; **crate2** is now in **depot48-2-3**; Hoist0 becomes available.

**Summary of the Plan:**

- **Crate0** is moved to **depot48-2-2**.
- **Crate1** is moved to **depot48-2-1**.
- **Crate2** is moved to **depot48-2-3**.
- **Crate3** is moved to **depot48-2-4**.
- **Hoist0** ends up in **depot48-2-4**, available for further tasks.

**This plan ensures all crates are moved to the depot store areas in **depot48** efficiently, utilizing the clear areas and considering the connectivity between areas.**
