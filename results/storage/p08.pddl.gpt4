Sure, here is a sequence of actions that could be used to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to loadarea. 
   
2. "lift" hoist0 to pick up crate0 from container-0-0.

3. "go-in" hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.

4. "drop" hoist0 to place crate0 into depot48-2-1.

5. "go-out" hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.

6. "lift" hoist0 to pick up crate2 from container-0-2.

7. "go-in" hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.

8. "drop" hoist0 to place crate2 into depot48-2-2.

9. "go-out" hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.

10. "lift" hoist0 to pick up crate1 from container-0-1.

11. "go-in" hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-3.

12. "drop" hoist0 to place crate1 into depot48-2-3.

This sequence of steps ensures that each crate is taken from its store area, moved to the depot, and then placed in a depot store area. Each step follows the necessary preconditions and helps to reach the goal of the planning problem - to move all crates to depot48.
