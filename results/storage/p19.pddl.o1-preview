To achieve the goal of moving all crates to `depot48` in an optimal way, we can create a plan that utilizes both hoists (`hoist0` and `hoist1`) efficiently. Below is the step-by-step optimal plan:

**Initial State Summary:**
- **Hoists:**
  - `hoist0` is available and located at `depot48-2-1`.
  - `hoist1` is available and located at `depot48-1-1`.
- **Crates:**
  - `crate0` is on `container-0-0`.
  - `crate1` is on `container-0-1`.
  - `crate2` is on `container-0-2`.
- **Store Areas:**
  - Clear depot store areas: `depot48-1-2`, `depot48-1-3`, `depot48-2-2`, `depot48-2-3`.
  - All container store areas are connected to `loadarea`.
  - `depot48-2-2` is connected to `loadarea`.

**Actions for Hoist0 to Move Crate0:**

1. **Move hoist0 to depot48-2-2:**
   - Action: `move(hoist0, depot48-2-1, depot48-2-2)`
   - Precondition: `hoist0` is at `depot48-2-1`, `depot48-2-2` is clear.
   - Effect: `hoist0` is now at `depot48-2-2`, `depot48-2-1` becomes clear.

2. **Go out from depot48-2-2 to loadarea:**
   - Action: `go-out(hoist0, depot48-2-2, loadarea)`
   - Precondition: `hoist0` is at `depot48-2-2`, `depot48-2-2` and `loadarea` are connected.
   - Effect: `hoist0` is now at `loadarea`, `depot48-2-2` becomes clear.

3. **Lift crate0 from container-0-0:**
   - Action: `lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, loadarea, container0)`
   - Precondition: 
     - `hoist0` is at `loadarea` and available.
     - `crate0` is on `container-0-0`.
     - `container-0-0` is in `container0`.
   - Effect:
     - `hoist0` is lifting `crate0` and becomes unavailable.
     - `container-0-0` becomes clear.

4. **Go in to depot48-2-2 with crate0:**
   - Action: `go-in(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-2-2)`
   - Precondition: 
     - `hoist0` (lifting `crate0`) is at `loadarea`.
     - `depot48-2-2` is clear.
     - `loadarea` and `depot48-2-2` are connected.
   - Effect: `hoist0` is at `depot48-2-2`, `depot48-2-2` becomes occupied.

5. **Drop crate0 at depot48-2-2:**
   - Action: `drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-2-2, depot48-2-2, depot48)`
   - Precondition: 
     - `hoist0` is at `depot48-2-2` lifting `crate0`.
     - `depot48-2-2` is considered clear for dropping since the hoist is the one lifting the crate.
   - Effect:
     - `hoist0` becomes available.
     - `crate0` is now in `depot48-2-2`.
     - `depot48-2-2` remains occupied by `crate0`.

**Actions for Hoist1 to Move Crate1:**

6. **Move hoist1 to depot48-1-2:**
   - Action: `move(hoist1, depot48-1-1, depot48-1-2)`
   - Precondition: `hoist1` is at `depot48-1-1`, `depot48-1-2` is clear.
   - Effect: `hoist1` is now at `depot48-1-2`, `depot48-1-1` becomes clear.

7. **Move hoist1 to depot48-2-2:**
   - Action: `move(hoist1, depot48-1-2, depot48-2-2)`
   - Precondition: `hoist1` is at `depot48-1-2`, `depot48-2-2` is now clear after `crate0` was dropped.
   - Effect: `hoist1` is at `depot48-2-2`, `depot48-1-2` becomes clear.

8. **Go out from depot48-2-2 to loadarea:**
   - Action: `go-out(hoist1, depot48-2-2, loadarea)`
   - Precondition: `hoist1` is at `depot48-2-2`.
   - Effect: `hoist1` is now at `loadarea`, `depot48-2-2` becomes clear.

9. **Lift crate1 from container-0-1:**
   - Action: `lift(hoist1, crate1, container-0-1, loadarea, container0)`
   - Precondition: Similar to previous `lift` action for `crate0`.

10. **Go in to depot48-1-2 with crate1:**
    - Action: `go-in(hoist1, loadarea, depot48-1-2)`
    - Precondition: 
      - `hoist1` (lifting `crate1`) is at `loadarea`.
      - `depot48-1-2` is clear.
    - Effect: `hoist1` is at `depot48-1-2`, `depot48-1-2` becomes occupied.

11. **Drop crate1 at depot48-1-2:**
    - Action: `drop(hoist1, crate1, depot48-1-2, depot48-1-2, depot48)`
    - Precondition: Similar to previous `drop` action.

    - Precondition: `hoist0` is at `depot48-2-2`.
    - Effect: `hoist0` is now at `loadarea`, `depot48-2-2` becomes clear.

13. **Lift crate2 from container-0-2:**

      - `hoist0` (lifting `crate2`) is at `loadarea`.
      - `depot48-2-3` is clear.
    - Effect: `hoist0` is at `depot48-2-3`, `depot48-2-3` becomes occupied.

15. **Drop crate2 at depot48-2-3:**
    - Action: `drop(hoist0, crate2, depot48-2-3, depot48-2-3, depot48)`

**Summary of the Plan Steps:**

- **Hoist0 Actions:**
  1. Move to `depot48-2-2`.
  2. Go out to `loadarea`.
  3. Lift `crate0` from `container-0-0`.
  4. Go in to `depot48-2-2` with `crate0`.
  5. Drop `crate0` at `depot48-2-2`.
  6. Go out to `loadarea`.
  7. Lift `crate2` from `container-0-2`.
  8. Go in to `depot48-2-3` with `crate2`.
  9. Drop `crate2` at `depot48-2-3`.

- **Hoist1 Actions:**
  1. Move to `depot48-1-2`.
  2. Move to `depot48-2-2`.
  3. Go out to `loadarea`.
  4. Lift `crate1` from `container-0-1`.
  5. Go in to `depot48-1-2` with `crate1`.
  6. Drop `crate1` at `depot48-1-2`.

**Notes:**

- By using both hoists in parallel, we minimize the total number of actions and avoid bottlenecks at `depot48-2-2`.
- The plan ensures that all actions' preconditions are met and effects are properly applied.
- The plan moves each crate directly to a clear depot store area, efficiently utilizing the available clear store areas.
- The hoists only occupy clear areas and free them up after moving, allowing for smooth transitions.

**Conclusion:**

This sequence of actions provides an optimal plan to move all crates from the container store areas to `depot48`, utilizing both hoists effectively while adhering to all action preconditions and effects. The plan ensures that all crates are moved to `depot48` in the least number of steps possible, satisfying the goal of the problem.
