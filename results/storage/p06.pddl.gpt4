Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Use the "lift" action to lift the crate0 which is on container-0-0 using hoist1, which should be in loadarea.
2. Use the "move" action to move the hoist1 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
3. Use the "drop" action to drop the crate0 from hoist1 in depot48-2-1.
4. Use the "go-out" action to move hoist1 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
5. Use the "lift" action to lift the crate1 which is on container-0-1 using hoist1.
6. Use the "move" action to move the hoist1 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
7. Use the "drop" action to drop the crate1 from hoist1 in depot48-2-1.
  
This will result in all the crates being moved to depot48.
