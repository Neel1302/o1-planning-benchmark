To solve this problem, we need to move crate0 from its initial location in container0 (specifically on container-0-0) to depot48. Here's an optimal plan consisting of four actions:

1. **Action**: `go-out(hoist0, depot48-1-1, loadarea)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - hoist0 is in `depot48-1-1`.
     - `depot48-1-1` and `loadarea` are connected.
   - **Effects**:
     - Remove hoist0 from `depot48-1-1`.
     - Place hoist0 in `loadarea`.
     - `depot48-1-1` becomes clear.

2. **Action**: `lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, loadarea, container0)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - hoist0 is available.
     - hoist0 is at `loadarea`.
     - crate0 is on the surface in `container-0-0`.
     - `container-0-0` is in `container0`.
   - **Effects**:
     - Remove crate0 from `container-0-0`.
     - `container-0-0` becomes clear.
     - hoist0 becomes unavailable.
     - hoist0 is lifting crate0.
     - Remove crate0 from `container0`.

3. **Action**: `go-in(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-1)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - hoist0 is in `loadarea`.
     - `loadarea` and `depot48-1-1` are connected.
     - `depot48-1-1` is clear.
   - **Effects**:
     - Remove hoist0 from `loadarea`.
     - Place hoist0 in `depot48-1-1`.
     - `depot48-1-1` becomes occupied.

4. **Action**: `drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-1, depot48)`
   - **Preconditions**:
     - hoist0 is at `depot48-1-1`.
     - hoist0 is lifting crate0.
     - `depot48-1-1` is clear (Note: In this context, "clear" means not occupied by another crate; the hoist being present does not affect this).
     - `depot48-1-1` is in `depot48`.
   - **Effects**:
     - hoist0 stops lifting crate0.
     - hoist0 becomes available.
     - `depot48-1-1` becomes occupied by crate0.
     - crate0 is in `depot48-1-1`.

**Summary of the Optimal Plan**:

- Move hoist0 from depot48-1-1 to loadarea.
- Use hoist0 to lift crate0 from container-0-0 while at loadarea.
- Move hoist0 (while lifting crate0) back into depot48-1-1.
- Drop crate0 in depot48-1-1.

This sequence efficiently moves crate0 from its initial location to the goal location in depot48, utilizing the hoist and the available actions without unnecessary steps.

An optimal plan:
1. go-out(hoist0, depot48-1-1, loadarea)
2. lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, loadarea, container0)
3. go-in(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-1)
4. drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-1, depot48)
