Here's a sequence of actions that might accomplish the goal:

1. Go-in: Move hoist0 from depot48-1-3 to depot48-2-1. (Preconditions: hoist0 is in depot48-1-3, depot48-1-3 and depot48-2-1 are connected, depot48-2-1 is clear.)

2. Move: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea. (Preconditions: hoist0 is in depot48-2-1, loadarea is clear, depot48-2-1 and loadarea are connected.)

3. Lift: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0 to the loadarea. (Preconditions: hoist0 is available, hoist0 is at the loadarea, crate0 is on the ground in container-0-0, container-0-0 is in container0.)

4. Move: Move hoist0 carrying crate0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1. (Preconditions: hoist0 is in loadarea, depot48-2-1 is clear, loadarea and depot48-2-1 are connected.)

5. Drop: Drop crate0 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-1. (Preconditions: hoist0 is at depot48-2-1, hoist0 is lifting crate0, depot48-2-1 is clear, depot48-2-1 is in depot48.)

6-10. Repeat steps 2-5 for crate1 and crate2, placing them on different clear spots in depot48.

With this sequence of actions, we would be able to move all the crates from the container storeareas to the depot storeareas, thus achieving the goal. 

Note: This is assuming that the hoist can carry only one crate at a time. If there's an ability to move multiple crates in one lift, the plan might be different.

Apparently the precise actions may vary a bit depending on the exact preconditions and effects of each action in the domain. An optimal plan would need to minimize the number of actions based on these conditions. In a real-world scenario, optimizing might also involve considerations like minimizing the physical distance travelled or the time taken.
