Here is a sequence of actions that can be taken to move all the crates to the depot48:

1. "go-out" hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to loadarea.
2. "move" hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-0.
3. "lift" hoist0 crate0 from container-0-0 to loadarea.
4. "go-in" hoist0 with crate0 from loadarea to depot48-1-1.
5. "drop" hoist0 with crate0 at depot48-1-1.

Repeat steps 1-5 for each of the other hoists and crates, substituting the appropriate hoist, crate, and container-0-x numbers each time. 

For example, to move crate1 to depot48-1-2, the sequence would be:

6. "go-out" hoist1 from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
7. "move" hoist1 from loadarea to container-0-1.
8. "lift" hoist1 crate1 from container-0-1 to loadarea.
9. "go-in" hoist1 with crate1 from loadarea to depot48-1-2.
10. "drop" hoist1 with crate1 at depot48-1-2.

And to move crate2 to depot48-1-3, the sequence would be:

11. "go-out" hoist2 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
12. "move" hoist2 from loadarea to container-0-2.
13. "lift" hoist2 crate2 from container-0-2 to loadarea.
14. "go-in" hoist2 with crate2 from loadarea to depot48-1-3.
15. "drop" hoist2 with crate2 at depot48-1-3.

In this plan, each hoist is assigned one crate to move, which minimizes the time it takes to complete the goal.
