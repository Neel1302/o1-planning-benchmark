This is a problem of logistics, where we need to find the optimal plan to move all crates from their current locations to a specific depot using a hoist. Below is a proposed plan assuming all procedures take an equal duration and the goal is to minimize the amount of actions (i.e., lifting, dropping, and moving). Sometimes, the hoist needs to move empty because a destination is blocked by a crate that must be moved somewhere else first.

1. move(hoist0, depot48-1-1, depot48-1-2)
2. lift(hoist0, crate1, container-0-1)
3. move(hoist0, depot48-1-2, depot48-1-3)
4. go-out(hoist0, depot48-1-3, loadarea)
5. drop(hoist0, crate1, container-0-1)
6. go-in(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-2-3)
7. move(hoist0, depot48-2-3, depot48-2-2)
8. lift(hoist0, crate2, container-0-2)
9. move(hoist0, depot48-2-2, depot48-2-1)
10. go-out(hoist0, depot48-2-1, loadarea)
11. drop(hoist0, crate2, container-0-2)
12. go-in(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-2-4)
13. lift(hoist0, crate3, container-0-3)
14. go-out(hoist0, depot48-2-4, loadarea)
15. drop(hoist0, crate3, container-0-3)
16. go-in(hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-4)
17. move(hoist0, depot48-1-4, depot48-1-3)
18. lift(hoist0, crate0, container-0-0)
19. move(hoist0, depot48-1-3, depot48-1-2)
20. move(hoist0, depot48-1-2, depot48-1-1)
21. drop(hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-1)

This solution is based on the initial positions and makes several assumptions, such as that all moving and lifting/dropping actions take the same amount of time and crates are moved in a sequence: crate1--> crate2--> crate3--> crate0. Please note that there may be other optimal solutions in terms of time or distance, depending on the specifics of the task, such as the speed of the hoist or the distance between locations, etc.
