Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to move all crates from the container store areas to the depot (`depot48`) using the available hoists. The plan leverages two hoists (`hoist0` and `hoist1`) to operate concurrently, ensuring efficiency.

### **Initial State:**
- **Hoist Locations:**
  - `hoist0` is in `depot48-2-2`
  - `hoist1` is in `depot48-2-1`
  - `hoist2` is in `depot48-1-2` (available but not needed for this optimal plan)
- **Crates:**
  - `crate0` is in `container-0-0`
  - `crate1` is in `container-0-1`
- **Load Area:**
  - Connected to all container store areas and `depot48-2-1`

### **Plan Overview:**
1. **Hoist1 handles `crate0`**
2. **Hoist0 handles `crate1`**

### **Detailed Step-by-Step Actions:**

#### **Hoist1: Moving `crate0`**
1. **Go-Out to Load Area**
   - **Action:** `hoist1` performs `go-out` from `depot48-2-1` to `loadarea`.
   - **Precondition:** `hoist1` is in `depot48-2-1` and connected to `loadarea`.
   - **Effect:** `hoist1` is now in `loadarea`.

2. **Lift `crate0`**
   - **Action:** `hoist1` performs `lift` to pick up `crate0` from `container-0-0` to `loadarea`.
   - **Precondition:** `hoist1` is in `loadarea`, `crate0` is in `container-0-0`, and all other lift preconditions are met.
   - **Effect:** `crate0` is now held by `hoist1` in `loadarea`.

3. **Go-In to Depot**
   - **Action:** `hoist1` performs `go-in` from `loadarea` to `depot48-2-1`.
   - **Precondition:** `hoist1` is in `loadarea` and connected to `depot48-2-1`, which is clear.
   - **Effect:** `hoist1` is back in `depot48-2-1` holding `crate0`.

4. **Drop `crate0`**
   - **Action:** `hoist1` performs `drop` to place `crate0` in `depot48-2-1`.
   - **Precondition:** `hoist1` is in `depot48-2-1` holding `crate0`, and `depot48-2-1` is clear.
   - **Effect:** `crate0` is now in `depot48-2-1`, and `hoist1` becomes available.

#### **Hoist0: Moving `crate1`**
5. **Move to Depot Connection**
   - **Action:** `hoist0` performs `move` from `depot48-2-2` to `depot48-2-1`.
   - **Precondition:** `depot48-2-1` is clear.
   - **Effect:** `hoist0` is now in `depot48-2-1`.

6. **Go-Out to Load Area**
   - **Action:** `hoist0` performs `go-out` from `depot48-2-1` to `loadarea`.
   - **Precondition:** `hoist0` is in `depot48-2-1` and connected to `loadarea`.
   - **Effect:** `hoist0` is now in `loadarea`.

7. **Lift `crate1`**
   - **Action:** `hoist0` performs `lift` to pick up `crate1` from `container-0-1` to `loadarea`.
   - **Precondition:** `hoist0` is in `loadarea`, `crate1` is in `container-0-1`, and all other lift preconditions are met.
   - **Effect:** `crate1` is now held by `hoist0` in `loadarea`.

8. **Go-In to Depot**
   - **Action:** `hoist0` performs `go-in` from `loadarea` to `depot48-2-1`.
   - **Precondition:** `hoist0` is in `loadarea` and connected to `depot48-2-1`, which is now clear after `crate0` has been placed.
   - **Effect:** `hoist0` is back in `depot48-2-1` holding `crate1`.

9. **Drop `crate1`**
   - **Action:** `hoist0` performs `drop` to place `crate1` in `depot48-2-1`.
   - **Precondition:** `hoist0` is in `depot48-2-1` holding `crate1`, and `depot48-2-1` is clear.
   - **Effect:** `crate1` is now in `depot48-2-1`, and `hoist0` becomes available.

### **Summary of Actions:**

1. `hoist1` **go-out** from `depot48-2-1` to `loadarea`
2. `hoist1` **lift** `crate0` from `container-0-0` to `loadarea`
3. `hoist1` **go-in** from `loadarea` to `depot48-2-1`
4. `hoist1` **drop** `crate0` in `depot48-2-1`
5. `hoist0` **move** from `depot48-2-2` to `depot48-2-1`
6. `hoist0` **go-out** from `depot48-2-1` to `loadarea`
7. `hoist0` **lift** `crate1` from `container-0-1` to `loadarea`
8. `hoist0` **go-in** from `loadarea` to `depot48-2-1`
9. `hoist0` **drop** `crate1` in `depot48-2-1`

### **Final State:**
- Both `crate0` and `crate1` are successfully moved to `depot48-2-1`.
- All hoists are available and positioned as follows:
  - `hoist0` in `depot48-2-1`
  - `hoist1` in `depot48-2-1`
  - `hoist2` remains in `depot48-1-2`

This plan ensures that both crates are moved efficiently using two hoists operating in parallel, minimizing the total number of actions required.
