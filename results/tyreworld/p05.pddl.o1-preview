To solve the problem optimally, the following sequence of actions can be performed:

**Initial Actions:**

1. **Open** the boot (since it is unlocked and closed).
2. **Fetch** the jack from the boot (agent now has the jack).
3. **Fetch** the wrench from the boot (agent now has the wrench).
4. **Fetch** the pump from the boot (agent now has the pump).
5. **Fetch** intact tyre 1 from the boot (agent now has intact tyre 1).
6. **Fetch** intact tyre 2 from the boot (agent now has intact tyre 2).
7. **Fetch** intact tyre 3 from the boot (agent now has intact tyre 3).
8. **Fetch** intact tyre 4 from the boot (agent now has intact tyre 4).
9. **Fetch** intact tyre 5 from the boot (agent now has intact tyre 5).

**For each hub (repeat steps for hubs 1 to 5):**

*Note: Replace "hub X" and "tyre X" with the appropriate numbers from 1 to 5.*

**Hub X Operations:**

10. **Loosen** the nut on hub X:
    - Preconditions: Agent has the wrench, nut on hub X is tight, hub X is on the ground.
    - Effect: Nut on hub X is loose.

11. **Jack-up** hub X:
    - Preconditions: Agent has the jack, hub X is on the ground.
    - Effects: Hub X is off the ground, agent no longer has the jack (jack is in use under the hub).

12. **Undo** the nut from hub X:
    - Preconditions: Hub X is off the ground, hub X is fastened, agent has the wrench, nut on hub X is loose.
    - Effects: Agent has the nut, hub X is unfastened.

13. **Remove-wheel** (flat tyre) from hub X:
    - Preconditions: Hub X is off the ground, flat tyre X is on hub X, hub X is unfastened.
    - Effects: Agent has flat tyre X, hub X is free.

14. **Put-on-wheel** (intact tyre X) onto hub X:
    - Preconditions: Agent has intact tyre X, hub X is free, hub X is unfastened, hub X is off the ground.
    - Effects: Intact tyre X is on hub X, hub X is no longer free, agent no longer has intact tyre X.

15. **Do-up** the nut on hub X:
    - Preconditions: Agent has the wrench, hub X is unfastened, hub X is off the ground, agent has the nut.
    - Effects: Nut is loose on hub X, hub X is fastened, agent no longer has the nut.

16. **Inflate** tyre X:
    - Preconditions: Agent has the pump, intact tyre X (on hub X) is not inflated.
    - Effects: Intact tyre X is inflated.

17. **Jack-down** hub X:
    - Preconditions: Hub X is off the ground.
    - Effects: Hub X is on the ground, agent has the jack again.

18. **Tighten** the nut on hub X:
    - Preconditions: Agent has the wrench, nut on hub X is loose, hub X is on the ground.
    - Effects: Nut on hub X is tight.

**Final Actions:**

55. **Put-away** flat tyre 1 into the boot.
56. **Put-away** flat tyre 2 into the boot.
57. **Put-away** flat tyre 3 into the boot.
58. **Put-away** flat tyre 4 into the boot.
59. **Put-away** flat tyre 5 into the boot.
60. **Put-away** the jack into the boot.
61. **Put-away** the wrench into the boot.
62. **Put-away** the pump into the boot.
63. **Close** the boot.

**Summary of the Plan:**

- Open the boot and gather all necessary tools and intact tyres.
- For each hub:
  - Loosen the nut while the hub is on the ground.
  - Jack up the hub.
  - Remove the nut and the flat tyre.
  - Install the intact tyre and partially secure it with the nut.
  - Inflate the tyre.
  - Lower the hub back to the ground.
  - Fully tighten the nut.
- After replacing tyres on all hubs, put all flat tyres and tools back into the boot and close it.

This plan ensures that all flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres on the hubs, the nuts are tight, all flat tyres and tools are stored back in the boot, and the boot is closed, meeting all the goals with an optimal sequence of actions.
