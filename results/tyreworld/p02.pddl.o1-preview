To solve this problem optimally, we need to efficiently replace the flat tyres with inflated intact tyres on the hubs, ensure the nuts are tight, and return the flat tyres and tools to the boot, closing it afterward. Below is the sequence of actions that achieves the goal in the minimal number of steps (107 actions):

**Initial Steps:**

1. **Open the boot** (precondition: boot is unlocked and closed; effect: boot is open).

2. **Fetch the pump** from the boot (precondition: pump is in the boot and boot is open; effect: agent has the pump).

3-11. **Inflate the intact tyres inside the boot**:
   - For each intact tyre (tyres 1 to 9):
     - **Inflate** the tyre using the pump (precondition: agent has the pump, tyre is intact and not inflated; effect: tyre is inflated).

12. **Put away the pump** into the boot (precondition: agent has the pump and boot is open; effect: pump is in the boot).

13. **Fetch the wrench** from the boot (precondition: wrench is in the boot and boot is open; effect: agent has the wrench).

14. **Fetch the jack** from the boot (precondition: jack is in the boot and boot is open; effect: agent has the jack).

**For Each Hub (Repeat Steps 15-23 for hubs 1 to 9):**

15. **Loosen the nut** on the hub (precondition: agent has wrench, nut on hub is tight, hub is on the ground; effect: nut on hub is loose).

16. **Jack up the hub** (precondition: agent has the jack, hub is on the ground; effect: hub is not on the ground, agent does not have the jack).

17. **Undo the nut** on the hub (precondition: hub is not on the ground, hub is fastened, agent has wrench, nut is loose; effect: agent has the nut, hub is unfastened).

18. **Remove the flat tyre** from the hub (precondition: hub is not on the ground, wheel is on hub, hub is unfastened; effect: agent has the flat tyre, hub is free).

19. **Fetch the inflated intact tyre** from the boot (precondition: tyre is in the boot and boot is open; effect: agent has the inflated tyre).

20. **Put on the inflated intact tyre** onto the hub (precondition: agent has the tyre, hub is free, hub is unfastened, hub is not on the ground; effect: tyre is on the hub, hub is not free, agent no longer has the tyre).

21. **Do-up the nut** on the hub (precondition: agent has wrench, hub is unfastened, hub is not on the ground, agent has the nut; effect: nut is loose on the hub, hub is fastened, agent no longer has the nut).

22. **Jack down the hub** (precondition: hub is not on the ground; effect: hub is on the ground, agent has the jack).

23. **Tighten the nut** on the hub (precondition: agent has wrench, nut on hub is loose, hub is on the ground; effect: nut on hub is tight).

**Final Steps:**

24-32. **Put away the flat tyres** into the boot:
   - For each flat tyre (tyres 1 to 9):
     - **Put away** the flat tyre (precondition: agent has the flat tyre and boot is open; effect: flat tyre is in the boot).

33. **Put away the wrench** into the boot (precondition: agent has the wrench and boot is open; effect: wrench is in the boot).

34. **Put away the jack** into the boot (precondition: agent has the jack and boot is open; effect: jack is in the boot).

35. **Close the boot** (precondition: boot is open; effect: boot is closed).

This plan efficiently sequences the actions, minimizes unnecessary steps, and ensures that all tools and flat tyres are returned to the boot before closing it. By inflating the tyres inside the boot and fetching each tyre only when needed, we reduce the number of fetch actions. The total number of actions is 107, which is optimal given the constraints and action definitions provided.

**Optimal Plan Summary (Total Actions: 107):**

1. Open boot.
2. Fetch pump.
3-11. Inflate intact tyres 1-9 in boot.
12. Put away pump.
13. Fetch wrench.
14. Fetch jack.
15-23. For each hub (1-9), perform:
    - Loosen nut.
    - Jack up hub.
    - Undo nut.
    - Remove flat tyre.
    - Fetch inflated tyre from boot.
    - Put on inflated tyre.
    - Do-up nut.
    - Jack down hub.
    - Tighten nut.
24-32. Put away flat tyres into boot.
33. Put away wrench into boot.
34. Put away jack into boot.
35. Close boot.
