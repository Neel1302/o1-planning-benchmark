### **Processing Each Hub (Hub 1, Hub 2, Hub 3)**

Repeat the following steps for **Hub 1**, **Hub 2**, and **Hub 3** respectively.

#### **a. Loosen the Nut**

    - *Precondition:* Boot is open.
    - *Effect:* Boot is closed.

#### **f. Attach the Intact Tyre**

16. **Put-on intact tyre X onto Hub X.**
    - *Precondition:* Agent holds intact tyre X; Hub X is free and unfastened; Hub X is lifted.
    - *Effect:* Intact tyre X is on Hub X; Hub X is no longer free; agent no longer holds intact tyre X.

17. **Inflate the intact tyre on Hub X.**
    - *Precondition:* Agent has the pump; intact tyre X is not inflated; tyre is intact.
    - *Effect:* Intact tyre X is inflated.

#### **g. Fasten the Nut**

18. **Do-up the nut on Hub X.**
    - *Precondition:* Agent has the wrench; Hub X is unfastened and lifted; agent holds the nut.
    - *Effect:* Nut is loose on Hub X; Hub X is fastened; agent no longer holds the nut.

19. **Jack-down Hub X.**
    - *Precondition:* Hub X is lifted.
    - *Effect:* Hub X is on the ground; agent holds the jack.

20. **Tighten the nut on Hub X.**
    - *Precondition:* Agent has the wrench; nut on Hub X is loose; Hub X is on the ground.
    - *Effect:* Nut on Hub X is tight.

### **Finalizing: Storing Tools**

21. **Open the boot.**
    - *Precondition:* Boot is closed.
    - *Effect:* Boot is open.

22. **Put-away the wrench into the boot.**
    - *Precondition:* Agent holds the wrench; boot is open.
    - *Effect:* Wrench is in the boot; agent no longer holds the wrench.

23. **Put-away the pump into the boot.**
    - *Precondition:* Agent holds the pump; boot is open.
    - *Effect:* Pump is in the boot; agent no longer holds the pump.

24. **Put-away the jack into the boot.**
    - *Precondition:* Agent holds the jack; boot is open.
    - *Effect:* Jack is in the boot; agent no longer holds the jack.

25. **Close the boot.**
    - *Precondition:* Boot is open.
    - *Effect:* Boot is closed.

### **Notes:**

- **Hub X** refers to Hub 1, Hub 2, and Hub 3 in their respective iterations.
- Ensure that the **boot remains unlocked** throughout the process to facilitate opening and closing without locking issues.
- The **wrench**, **pump**, and **jack** are fetched once at the beginning and stored back at the end to minimize repeated fetch and put-away actions.
- **Inflation** of each intact tyre is done immediately after it is mounted to ensure all tyres are inflated before finalizing the nuts.

By following this plan meticulously, all flat tyres will be replaced with intact and inflated tyres, tools will be securely stored back in the boot along with the flat tyres, and the boot will remain closed, fulfilling all the specified goals.
