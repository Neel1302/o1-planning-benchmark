32. **Undo the fastening of the nut** on Hub 3 using the "undo" action.
33. **Remove the flat tyre** from Hub 3 using the "remove-wheel" action.
34. **Put on the inflated intact tyre 3** onto Hub 3 using the "put-on-wheel" action.
35. **Do up the nut** on Hub 3 using the "do-up" action.
36. **Jack down Hub 3** using the "jack-down" action.
37. **Tighten the nut** on Hub 3 using the "tighten" action.

*For Hub 4:*

38. **Loosen the nut** on Hub 4 using the "loosen" action.
39. **Jack up Hub 4** using the "jack-up" action.
40. **Undo the fastening of the nut** on Hub 4 using the "undo" action.
41. **Remove the flat tyre** from Hub 4 using the "remove-wheel" action.
42. **Put on the inflated intact tyre 4** onto Hub 4 using the "put-on-wheel" action.
43. **Do up the nut** on Hub 4 using the "do-up" action.
44. **Jack down Hub 4** using the "jack-down" action.
45. **Tighten the nut** on Hub 4 using the "tighten" action.

**Final Steps:**

46. **Put away flat tyre 1** into the boot using the "put-away" action.
47. **Put away flat tyre 2** into the boot using the "put-away" action.
48. **Put away flat tyre 3** into the boot using the "put-away" action.
49. **Put away flat tyre 4** into the boot using the "put-away" action.
50. **Put away the wrench** into the boot using the "put-away" action.
51. **Put away the jack** into the boot using the "put-away" action.
52. **Close the boot** using the "close" action.

**Explanation:**

- **Steps 1-13:** Open the boot and fetch all necessary tools and tyres, inflating the intact tyres using the pump. The pump is then returned to the boot.
- **Steps 14-45:** For each hub, you perform the sequence of actions required to replace the flat tyre with the inflated intact tyre, ensuring all nuts are loosened, hubs are jacked up and down appropriately, and nuts are tightened at the end.
- **Steps 46-52:** After all hubs have been addressed, you put away all flat tyres and tools back into the boot and close it.

This plan ensures all the goals are met:

- Flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres on the hubs.
- Nuts are tight on the hubs.
- All flat tyres, the wrench, jack, and pump are in the boot.
- The boot is closed at the end.

This plan is optimal as it minimizes the number of actions by efficiently organizing the sequence and combining actions where possible according to the domain's action definitions.
