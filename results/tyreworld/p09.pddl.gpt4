An optimal plan to solve the problem could be composed of the following sequence of behaviours:

1. "open" action: Open the boot.
2. "fetch" action: Fetch the jack from the boot.
3. "fetch" action: Fetch the wrench from the boot.
4. "fetch" action: Fetch the pump from the boot.
5. "fetch" action: Fetch an intact tyre (we'll call this Tyre1) from the boot.
6. "inflate" action: Inflate Tyre1 using the pump.
7. "put-away" action: Put the pump back in the boot.
8. "jack-up" action: Jack up Hub1 (the hub with the first flat tyre).
9. "loosen" action: Loosen the nut on Hub1.
10. "undo" action: Undo the nut on Hub1.
11. "remove-wheel" action: Remove the flat tyre from Hub1.
12. "put-away" action: Put the flat tyre in the boot.
13. "put-on-wheel" action: Put Tyre1 onto Hub1.
14. "do-up" action: Fasten the nut onto Hub1.    
15. "tighten" action: Tighten the nut on Hub1.
16. "jack-down" action: Jack down Hub1.

Repeat this cycle 8 more times for the remaining hubs and tyres. After the last cycle:

17. "put-away" action: Put the wrench in the boot.
18. "put-away" action: Put the jack in the boot.
19. "close" action: Close the boot.

This sequence of behaviours ensures that each tyre is inflated, then placed onto a hub, while the flat tyre it replaces is put into the boot, the tools are retrieved and replaced as necessary, and the end state is as requested in the problem.
