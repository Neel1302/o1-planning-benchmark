To solve the problem of replacing the flat tyres with intact, inflated tyres on the hubs while ensuring the nuts are tight, the tools are back in the boot, and the boot is closed, we need to create an optimal plan that minimizes the number of actions. Below is the sequence of actions that achieves the goal:

**Initial Steps:**

1. **Open the boot.**  
   *(Precondition: Boot is unlocked and closed; Effect: Boot is open and not closed.)*

2. **Fetch the wrench from the boot.**  
   *(Precondition: Wrench is inside the boot and boot is open; Effect: Agent has the wrench and wrench is not inside the boot.)*

3. **Fetch the jack from the boot.**  
   *(Precondition: Jack is inside the boot and boot is open; Effect: Agent has the jack and jack is not inside the boot.)*

4. **Fetch the pump from the boot.**  
   *(Precondition: Pump is inside the boot and boot is open; Effect: Agent has the pump and pump is not inside the boot.)*

5. **Fetch all 7 intact tyres from the boot, one at a time.**  
   *(7 Actions: Precondition: Each intact tyre is inside the boot and boot is open; Effect: Agent has each intact tyre and it's not inside the boot.)*

**Inflate Intact Tyres:**

6. **Inflate each of the 7 intact tyres using the pump.**  
   *(7 Actions: For each tyre, Precondition: Agent has the pump, the tyre is not inflated, and tyre is intact; Effect: Tyre is inflated.)*

**Replace Flat Tyres on Each Hub (Repeat for all 7 hubs):**

For each hub (let's denote them as Hub#1 to Hub#7), perform the following actions:

**For Hub#i:**

7. **Loosen the nut on Hub#i using the wrench.**  
   *(Precondition: Agent has the wrench, nut on Hub#i is tight, and Hub#i is on the ground; Effect: Nut on Hub#i is loose and not tight.)*

8. **Jack up Hub#i using the jack.**  
   *(Precondition: Agent has the jack, and Hub#i is on the ground; Effect: Hub#i is not on the ground, and agent no longer has the jack.)*

9. **Undo the nut on Hub#i using the wrench.**  
   *(Precondition: Hub#i is not on the ground, Hub#i is fastened, agent has the wrench, and nut is loose; Effect: Agent has the nut, Hub#i is unfastened, and nut is not loose.)*

10. **Remove the flat tyre from Hub#i.**  
    *(Precondition: Hub#i is not on the ground, flat tyre is on Hub#i, and Hub#i is unfastened; Effect: Agent has the flat tyre, Hub#i is free, and tyre is not on Hub#i.)*

11. **Install the inflated intact tyre onto Hub#i.**  
    *(Precondition: Agent has the inflated intact tyre, Hub#i is free, Hub#i is unfastened, and Hub#i is not on the ground; Effect: Tyre is on Hub#i, Hub#i is not free, and agent no longer has the tyre.)*

12. **Do up the nut on Hub#i using the wrench.**  
    *(Precondition: Agent has the wrench and the nut, Hub#i is unfastened, Hub#i is not on the ground; Effect: Nut is loose on Hub#i, Hub#i is fastened, agent no longer has the nut.)*

13. **Jack down Hub#i to the ground.**  
    *(Precondition: Hub#i is not on the ground; Effect: Hub#i is on the ground, and agent has the jack.)*

14. **Tighten the nut on Hub#i using the wrench.**  
    *(Precondition: Agent has the wrench, nut on Hub#i is loose, and Hub#i is on the ground; Effect: Nut on Hub#i is tight and not loose.)*

**Note:** Repeat steps 7-14 for each of the 7 hubs, replacing Hub#i with Hub#1 to Hub#7 accordingly.

**Final Steps:**

15. **Put away all flat tyres into the boot, one at a time.**  
    *(7 Actions: For each flat tyre, Precondition: Agent has the flat tyre and boot is open; Effect: Flat tyre is inside the boot and agent no longer has the flat tyre.)*

16. **Put away the wrench into the boot.**  
    *(Precondition: Agent has the wrench and boot is open; Effect: Wrench is inside the boot and agent no longer has the wrench.)*

17. **Put away the jack into the boot.**  
    *(Precondition: Agent has the jack and boot is open; Effect: Jack is inside the boot and agent no longer has the jack.)*

18. **Put away the pump into the boot.**  
    *(Precondition: Agent has the pump and boot is open; Effect: Pump is inside the boot and agent no longer has the pump.)*

19. **Close the boot.**  
    *(Precondition: Boot is open; Effect: Boot is closed and not open.)*

**Summary of Actions:**

- Open boot: 1 action
- Fetch tools (wrench, jack, pump): 3 actions
- Fetch intact tyres: 7 actions
- Inflate tyres: 7 actions
- Replace tyres on hubs: 7 hubs Ã— 8 actions each = 56 actions
- Put away flat tyres: 7 actions
- Put away tools: 3 actions
- Close boot: 1 action

**Total Actions:** **85 actions**

This plan is optimal given the constraints and action definitions provided. It ensures that all preconditions are met before each action, and all effects contribute towards achieving the goal state. By carrying multiple items when allowed and minimizing unnecessary actions, we achieve the goal efficiently.

**Final State Achieved:**

- Flat tyres are replaced with intact, inflated tyres on the hubs.
- Nuts are tight on the hubs.
- Flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump are inside the boot.
- Boot is closed.
