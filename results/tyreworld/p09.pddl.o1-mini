Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to replace the flat tyres with intact, inflated tyres on all 9 hubs while ensuring that all tools and items are properly stored back in the boot. The plan is structured to handle each hub sequentially, efficiently reusing tools where possible to minimize the total number of actions.

---

### **Overall Plan Structure:**

1. **Prepare the Boot:**
   - Open the boot.
   - Fetch all necessary tools (wrench, jack, pump) and keep them available for reuse.
   - Close the boot when tools are fetched.

2. **Process Each Hub (Repeated for Hubs 1 through 9):**
   - **a. Loosen and Remove Flat Tyre:**
     1. Fetch the wrench.
     2. Loosen the nut on the hub (`loosen` action).
     3. Jack up the hub (`jack-up` action).
     4. Undo the nut (`undo` action).
     5. Remove the flat tyre (`remove-wheel` action).
   
   - **b. Install Intact Tyre:**
     6. Fetch an intact tyre.
     7. Inflate the intact tyre using the pump (`inflate` action).
     8. Put away the pump if no longer needed immediately.
     9. Put the intact tyre onto the hub (`put-on-wheel` action).
     10. Do up (fasten) the nut (`do-up` action).
     11. Tighten the nut (`tighten` action).
     12. Jack down the hub (`jack-down` action).
   
   - **c. Store Tools and Flat Tyre:**
     13. Put away the wrench and jack.
     14. Place the removed flat tyre back into the boot (`put-away` action).

3. **Finalize:**
   - Ensure all tools (wrench, jack, pump) and the flat tyres are in the boot.
   - Close the boot.

### **Detailed Step-by-Step Actions:**

#### **1. Prepare the Boot:**
1. **Open** the boot.
2. **Fetch** the **wrench** from the boot.
3. **Fetch** the **jack** from the boot.
4. **Fetch** the **pump** from the boot.
5. **Close** the boot.

#### **2. Process Each Hub (Repeat Steps 6-19 for Each Hub):**

##### **For Hub 1 through Hub 9:**

**a. Loosen and Remove Flat Tyre:**
6. **Fetch** the **wrench** from where it's stored (if not already held).
7. **Loosen** the nut on the current hub (`loosen` action).
8. **Jack up** the current hub (`jack-up` action).
9. **Undo** the nut on the hub (`undo` action).
10. **Remove** the flat tyre from the hub (`remove-wheel` action).

**b. Install Intact Tyre:**
11. **Fetch** an **intact tyre** from the boot.
12. **Fetch** the **pump** if it's not already held.
13. **Inflate** the intact tyre (`inflate` action).
14. **Put away** the **pump** into the boot (`put-away` action), if inflation is complete.
15. **Put on** the **intact tyre** onto the hub (`put-on-wheel` action).
16. **Do-up** (fasten) the nut on the hub (`do-up` action).
17. **Tighten** the nut on the hub (`tighten` action).
18. **Jack down** the hub (`jack-down` action).

**c. Store Tools and Flat Tyre:**
19. **Put away** the **wrench** and **jack** into the boot (`put-away` action).
20. **Put away** the **removed flat tyre** into the boot (`put-away` action).

*Repeat steps 6-20 for each of the remaining hubs (Hub 2 through Hub 9).*

#### **3. Finalize:**
21. **Ensure** that all **intact tyres** are installed and **inflated**.
22. **Confirm** that all **nuts** are **tight** on each hub.
23. **Verify** that all tools (**wrench**, **jack**, **pump**) and the **flat tyres** are stored in the boot.
24. **Close** the boot.

### **Summary of Actions:**

- **Opening and Closing the Boot:**
  - **Open** the boot at the start.
  - **Close** the boot after fetching tools and again at the end.

- **Tool Management:**
  - **Fetch** tools from the boot as needed.
  - **Put away** tools back into the boot after their use is complete.

- **Tyre Replacement:**
  - **Loosen**, **undo**, **remove** the flat tyre.
  - **Fetch**, **inflate**, **install** the intact tyre.
  - **Do-up** and **tighten** the nut to secure the tyre.
  - **Jack up** and **jack down** the hub appropriately.

- **Final Checks:**
  - Ensure all goals are met: intact tyres are inflated and installed, nuts are tight, tools and flat tyres are stored in the boot, and the boot is closed.

By following this structured and repetitive approach for each hub, you ensure that all preconditions are met before performing actions and that the final goals are achieved efficiently.
