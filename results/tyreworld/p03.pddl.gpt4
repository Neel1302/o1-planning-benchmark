Here is a possible plan that meets the goal: 

1. "open" action: Open the boot.
2. "fetch" action: Fetch the jack from the boot.
3. "fetch" action: Fetch the wrench from the boot.
4. "fetch" action: Fetch the first intact tyre from the boot.
5. "fetch" action: Fetch the pump from the boot.
6. "inflate" action: Inflate the first intact tyre using the pump.
7. "put-away" action: Put the pump back inside the boot.
8. "jack-up" action: Jack-up the first hub using the jack.
9. "loosen" action: Loosen the nut of the first hub using the wrench.
10. "undo" action: Undo the fastening of the nut on the first hub.
11. "remove-wheel" action: Remove the flat tyre from the first hub.
12. "put-away" action: Put the flat tyre inside the boot.
13. "put-on-wheel" action: Put the first inflated intact tyre on the first hub.
14. "do-up" action: Fasten the nut on the first hub.
15. "tighten" action: Tighten the nut on the first hub.
16. "jack-down" action: Lower the first hub back to the ground.
17. "put-away" action: Put the jack back inside the boot.
18. "fetch" action: Fetch the jack from the boot.

These steps must be repeated for the remaining two hubs. 

After replacing all three flat tyres with inflated intact tyres:

19. "put-away" action: Put the wrench back inside the boot.
20. "close" action: Close the boot. 

You have now successfully replaced all flat tyres with inflated intact tyres, put all tools and flat tyres inside the boot, and closed it.
