Yes, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem, with a total of **195 actions**. We'll proceed step by step, ensuring we meet all the preconditions and effects defined in the domain.

**Initial Actions:**

1. **Open the boot** (since it's unlocked and closed).

2. **Fetch the pump** from the boot (agent now has the pump).

3. **Inflate all 17 intact tyres** while they are in the boot:
   - For each intact tyre \( h \) from 1 to 17:
     - **Inflate tyre \( h \)** (agent has the pump; tyre \( h \) is intact and not inflated).

4. **Fetch the wrench** from the boot (agent now has the wrench).

5. **Fetch the jack** from the boot (agent now has the jack).

**Per Hub Actions (for each hub \( h \) from 1 to 17):**

6. **Fetch inflated intact tyre \( h \)** from the boot (agent now has tyre \( h \)).

7. **Loosen the nut on hub \( h \)**:
   - Preconditions: agent has the wrench; the nut on hub \( h \) is tight; hub \( h \) is on the ground.
   - Effect: the nut on hub \( h \) is now loose.

8. **Jack up hub \( h \)**:
   - Preconditions: agent has the jack; hub \( h \) is on the ground.
   - Effects: hub \( h \) is not on the ground; agent no longer has the jack.

9. **Undo the nut on hub \( h \)**:
   - Preconditions: agent has the wrench; hub \( h \) is not on the ground; the nut is loose; hub \( h \) is fastened.
   - Effects: agent has the nut; hub \( h \) is unfastened; the nut is no longer loose; hub \( h \) is not fastened.

10. **Remove the flat tyre \( h \)** from hub \( h \):
    - Preconditions: hub \( h \) is not on the ground; flat tyre \( h \) is on hub \( h \); hub \( h \) is unfastened.
    - Effects: agent has flat tyre \( h \); hub \( h \) is free; flat tyre \( h \) is no longer on hub \( h \).

11. **Put the inflated intact tyre \( h \)** onto hub \( h \):
    - Preconditions: agent has tyre \( h \); hub \( h \) is free; hub \( h \) is unfastened; hub \( h \) is not on the ground.
    - Effects: tyre \( h \) is on hub \( h \); hub \( h \) is no longer free; agent no longer has tyre \( h \).

12. **Do up the nut on hub \( h \)**:
    - Preconditions: agent has the wrench; agent has the nut; hub \( h \) is unfastened; hub \( h \) is not on the ground.
    - Effects: the nut is now loose on hub \( h \); hub \( h \) is fastened; agent no longer has the nut.

13. **Jack down hub \( h \)**:
    - Preconditions: hub \( h \) is not on the ground.
    - Effects: hub \( h \) is on the ground; agent has the jack.

14. **Tighten the nut on hub \( h \)**:
    - Preconditions: agent has the wrench; the nut on hub \( h \) is loose; hub \( h \) is on the ground.
    - Effect: the nut on hub \( h \) is now tight.

15. **Put away flat tyre \( h \)** into the boot:
    - Preconditions: agent has flat tyre \( h \); the boot is open.
    - Effects: flat tyre \( h \) is inside the boot; agent no longer has flat tyre \( h \).

**Final Actions:**

16. **Put away the wrench** into the boot (agent no longer has the wrench).

17. **Put away the pump** into the boot (agent no longer has the pump).

18. **Put away the jack** into the boot (agent no longer has the jack).

19. **Close the boot** (since it's open).

**Total Actions:**

- **Initial actions:** 1 (opening boot) + 1 (fetching pump) + 17 (inflating tyres) + 1 (fetching wrench) + 1 (fetching jack) = **21 actions**.
- **Per hub actions:** 10 actions per hub \(\times\) 17 hubs = **170 actions**.
- **Final actions:** 3 (putting away tools) + 1 (closing boot) = **4 actions**.
- **Total:** 21 + 170 + 4 = **195 actions**.

**Summary Plan:**

1. Open boot.
2. Fetch pump.
3. Inflate intact tyres 1 to 17.
4. Fetch wrench.
5. Fetch jack.

For each hub \( h \) from 1 to 17:

6. Fetch inflated intact tyre \( h \) from boot.
7. Loosen nut on hub \( h \).
8. Jack up hub \( h \).
9. Undo nut on hub \( h \).
10. Remove flat tyre \( h \) from hub \( h \).
11. Put inflated intact tyre \( h \) on hub \( h \).
12. Do up nut on hub \( h \).
13. Jack down hub \( h \).
14. Tighten nut on hub \( h \).
15. Put away flat tyre \( h \) into boot.

Finally:

16. Put away wrench into boot.
17. Put away pump into boot.
18. Put away jack into boot.
19. Close boot.

This plan ensures that:

- All flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres on the hubs.
- The nuts are tight on the hubs.
- The flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump are in the boot.
- The boot is closed.

This is an optimal plan based on the given actions and constraints.
