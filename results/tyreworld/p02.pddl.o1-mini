Certainly! Below is an optimal sequence of actions to replace all 9 flat tyres with intact, inflated tyres, ensuring that all tools are returned to the boot and the boot is closed at the end.

### **Overall Strategy:**
1. **Prepare Tools and Materials:**
   - Open the boot.
   - Retrieve all necessary tools and intact tyres.
2. **Iteratively Replace Each Flat Tyre:**
   - For each of the 9 hubs, perform the sequence of actions required to replace the tyre.
3. **Finalize:**
   - Return all tools and flat tyres to the boot.
   - Close the boot.

### **Detailed Step-by-Step Plan:**

1. **Open the Boot:**
   - **Action:** `open`

2. **Fetch Necessary Tools and Intact Tyres:**
   - **Action:** `fetch wrench`
   - **Action:** `fetch jack`
   - **Action:** `fetch pump`
   - **Action:** For each intact tyre (total of 9):
     - **Action:** `fetch intact tyre`

3. **For Each of the 9 Hubs, Perform the Following Sequence:**
   
   _**Repeat the following 9 times, once for each hub:**_

   a. **Loosen the Nut on the Hub:**
      - **Action:** `loosen`
   
   b. **Jack Up the Hub:**
      - **Action:** `jack-up`
   
   c. **Remove the Flat Tyre from the Hub:**
      - **Action:** `remove-wheel`
   
   d. **Place the Intact Tyre onto the Hub:**
      - **Action:** `put-on-wheel`
   
   e. **Inflate the Intact Tyre:**
      - **Action:** `inflate`
   
   f. **Tighten the Nut on the Hub:**
      - **Action:** `tighten`
   
   g. **Lower the Hub Back to the Ground:**
      - **Action:** `jack-down`

4. **Return All Tools and Flat Tyres to the Boot:**
   - **Action:** For each tool and flat tyre:
     - **Action:** `put-away [object]` (Replace `[object]` with `wrench`, `jack`, `pump`, and each `flat tyre`.)

5. **Close the Boot:**
   - **Action:** `close`

### **Summary of Actions Sequence:**

1. `open`
2. `fetch wrench`
3. `fetch jack`
4. `fetch pump`
5. `fetch intact tyre` ×9
6. *(For each of the 9 hubs):*
   - `loosen`
   - `jack-up`
   - `remove-wheel`
   - `put-on-wheel`
   - `inflate`
   - `tighten`
   - `jack-down`
7. `put-away wrench`
8. `put-away jack`
9. `put-away pump`
10. `put-away flat tyre` ×9
11. `close`

### **Notes:**

- **Tool Management:** By fetching all necessary tools and intact tyres upfront, you minimize the number of times you need to access the boot, making the plan more efficient.
  
- **Sequential Processing:** Each hub is processed one after the other, ensuring that the tools are consistently used and managed without unnecessary delays.

- **Final State Compliance:** After executing all actions, all intact tyres will be inflated and securely fastened to their respective hubs. All tools, flat tyres, and the pump will be returned to the boot, and the boot will be closed, satisfying all goal conditions.

This plan ensures an efficient and orderly replacement of all flat tyres while adhering to all specified preconditions and effects of each action.
