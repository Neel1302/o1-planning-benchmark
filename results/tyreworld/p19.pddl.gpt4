Given your constraints, here is a sequence of behaviors that should provide a solution:

1. "Open" the boot.
2. "Fetch" the wrench, jack, and pump from the boot.
3. For each of the 19 hubs, repeat the following steps:
    1. Use the "fetch" action to get an intact, un-inflated tyre from the boot.
    2. Use the "inflate" action to inflate the intact tyre.
    3. Use the "put-away" action to place the pump back in the boot.
    4. Use the "jack-up" action to lift the hub.
    5. Use the "loosen" action to loosen the nut.
    6. Use the "undo" action to remove the nut from the hub.
    7. Use the "remove-wheel" action to remove the flat tyre.
    8. Use the "put-away" action to put the flat tyre in the boot.
    9. Use the "put-on-wheel" action to place the inflated tyre onto the hub.
    10. Use the "do-up" action to re-tighten the nut on the hub.
    11. Use the "jack-down" action to lower the hub back to the ground.
4. Once all the flat tyres have been replaced and put in the boot, use the "put-away" action to put the wrench and jack back in the boot.
5. "Close" the boot.

This sequence should satisfy all the conditions in your problem description, and actually leaves you with an extra inflated tyre that could be used as a spare. It also minimizes the number of times you need to open and close the boot, which may be beneficial if these actions take a significant amount of time.
