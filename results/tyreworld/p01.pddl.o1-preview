9. **Undo the nut from the hub**:  
   *Action*: `undo(nut1, hub1)`  
   *Preconditions*: `hub1 is not on the ground`, `hub1 is fastened`, `agent has wrench`, `nut1 is loose`  
   *Effects*: `agent has nut1`, `hub1 is unfastened`, `nut1 is not loose`, `hub1 is not fastened`

10. **Remove the flat tyre from the hub**:  
    *Action*: `remove-wheel(flatTyre1, hub1)`  
    *Preconditions*: `hub1 is not on the ground`, `flatTyre1 is on hub1`, `hub1 is unfastened`  
    *Effects*: `agent has flatTyre1`, `flatTyre1 is not on hub1` (hub is free)

11. **Put the intact tyre onto the hub**:  
    *Action*: `put-on-wheel(intactTyre1, hub1)`  
    *Preconditions*: `agent has intactTyre1`, `hub1 is free`, `hub1 is unfastened`, `hub1 is not on the ground`  
    *Effects*: `intactTyre1 is on hub1`, `hub1 is not free`, `agent does not have intactTyre1`

12. **Fasten the nut onto the hub**:  
    *Action*: `do-up(nut1, hub1)`  
    *Preconditions*: `agent has wrench`, `hub1 is unfastened`, `hub1 is not on the ground`, `agent has nut1`  
    *Effects*: `nut1 is loose on hub1`, `hub1 is fastened`, `hub1 is not unfastened`, `agent does not have nut1`

13. **Jack down the hub**:  
    *Action*: `jack-down(hub1)`  
    *Preconditions*: `hub1 is not on the ground`  
    *Effects*: `hub1 is on the ground`, `agent has jack`

14. **Tighten the nut on the hub**:  
    *Action*: `tighten(nut1, hub1)`  
    *Preconditions*: `agent has wrench`, `nut1 on hub1 is loose`, `hub1 is on the ground`  
    *Effects*: `nut1 on hub1 is tight`, `nut1 on hub1 is not loose`

15. **Put the flat tyre into the boot**:  
    *Action*: `put-away(flatTyre1, boot)`  
    *Preconditions*: `agent has flatTyre1`, `boot is open`  
    *Effects*: `flatTyre1 is inside the boot`, `agent does not have flatTyre1`

16. **Put the wrench into the boot**:  
    *Action*: `put-away(wrench, boot)`  
    *Preconditions*: `agent has wrench`, `boot is open`  
    *Effects*: `wrench is inside the boot`, `agent does not have wrench`

17. **Put the jack into the boot**:  
    *Action*: `put-away(jack, boot)`  
    *Preconditions*: `agent has jack`, `boot is open`  
    *Effects*: `jack is inside the boot`, `agent does not have jack`

18. **Put the pump into the boot**:  
    *Action*: `put-away(pump, boot)`  
    *Preconditions*: `agent has pump`, `boot is open`  
    *Effects*: `pump is inside the boot`, `agent does not have pump`

19. **Close the boot**:  
    *Action*: `close(boot)`  
    *Preconditions*: `boot is open`  
    *Effects*: `boot is closed`, `boot is not open`

**Explanation**:

- Steps 1-5: You open the boot and retrieve all necessary tools and the intact tyre.
- Step 6: You inflate the intact tyre using the pump.
- Steps 7-9: You loosen and remove the nut while the hub is on the ground, then jack up the hub.
- Steps 10-11: You remove the flat tyre and replace it with the inflated intact tyre.
- Steps 12-14: You fasten the nut on the hub, jack down the hub, and tighten the nut properly.
- Steps 15-18: You put all tools and the flat tyre back into the boot.
- Step 19: You close the boot as required.

This plan achieves all the goals:

- Replaces the flat tyre with the inflated intact tyre on the hub.
- Ensures the nut is tight on the hub.
- Returns the flat tyre, wrench, jack, and pump to the boot.
- Closes the boot.
