Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to replace all 17 flat tyres with intact tyres, ensuring that each intact tyre is inflated, nuts are tight on the hubs, and all tools and flat tyres are stored back in the boot with the boot closed. 

Given the repetitive nature of the task for each of the 17 hubs, the plan outlines the steps for **one hub**. You can **repeat these steps 17 times**—once for each hub—to achieve the complete goal.

### **Sequential Plan for One Hub**

1. **Open the Boot**
   - **Action:** `open`
   - **Preconditions:** Boot is unlocked and closed.
   - **Effects:** Boot is open and not closed.

2. **Fetch the Wrench**
   - **Action:** `fetch(wrench)`
   - **Preconditions:** Wrench is inside the open boot.
   - **Effects:** Agent is holding the wrench; wrench is not inside the boot.

3. **Fetch the Pump**
   - **Action:** `fetch(pump)`
   - **Preconditions:** Pump is inside the open boot.
   - **Effects:** Agent is holding the pump; pump is not inside the boot.

4. **Fetch the Jack**
   - **Action:** `fetch(jack)`
   - **Preconditions:** Jack is inside the open boot.
   - **Effects:** Agent is holding the jack; jack is not inside the boot.

5. **Fetch an Intact Tyre**
   - **Action:** `fetch(intact_tyre)`
   - **Preconditions:** Intact tyre is inside the open boot.
   - **Effects:** Agent is holding the intact tyre; intact tyre is not inside the boot.

6. **Loosen the Nuts on the Hub**
   - **Action:** `loosen`
   - **Preconditions:** Agent has the wrench, nuts are tight on the hub, hub is on the ground.
   - **Effects:** Nuts on the hub are loose and not tight.

7. **Jack Up the Hub**
   - **Action:** `jack-up`
   - **Preconditions:** Agent has the jack, hub is on the ground.
   - **Effects:** Hub is no longer on the ground; agent no longer has the jack.

8. **Remove the Flat Tyre from the Hub**
   - **Action:** `remove-wheel`
   - **Preconditions:** Hub is not on the ground, flat tyre is on the hub, hub is unfastened.
   - **Effects:** Agent has the removed flat tyre; hub is free (flat tyre is no longer on the hub).

9. **Put the Flat Tyre Back into the Boot**
   - **Action:** `put-away(flat_tyre)`
   - **Preconditions:** Agent is holding the flat tyre, boot is open.
   - **Effects:** Flat tyre is inside the boot; agent is not holding the flat tyre.

10. **Put the Jack Back into the Boot**
    - **Action:** `put-away(jack)`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent is holding the jack, boot is open.
    - **Effects:** Jack is inside the boot; agent is not holding the jack.

11. **Put the Wrench Back into the Boot**
    - **Action:** `put-away(wrench)`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent is holding the wrench, boot is open.
    - **Effects:** Wrench is inside the boot; agent is not holding the wrench.

12. **Put the Pump Back into the Boot**
    - **Action:** `put-away(pump)`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent is holding the pump, boot is open.
    - **Effects:** Pump is inside the boot; agent is not holding the pump.

13. **Put the Intact Tyre onto the Hub**
    - **Action:** `put-on-wheel`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent has the intact tyre, hub is free, hub is unfastened, hub is not on the ground.
    - **Effects:** Intact tyre is on the hub; hub is no longer free; agent is not holding the intact tyre.

14. **Tighten the Nuts on the Hub**
    - **Action:** `tighten`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent has the wrench, nuts are loose on the hub, hub is on the ground.
    - **Effects:** Nuts on the hub are tight and not loose.

15. **Lower the Hub Back to the Ground**
    - **Action:** `jack-down`
    - **Preconditions:** Hub is not on the ground.
    - **Effects:** Hub is on the ground; agent has the jack.

16. **Inflate the Intact Tyre**
    - **Action:** `inflate`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent has the pump, intact tyre is not inflated, intact tyre is intact.
    - **Effects:** Intact tyre is inflated.

17. **Close the Boot**
    - **Action:** `close`
    - **Preconditions:** Boot is open.
    - **Effects:** Boot is closed and not open.

### **Repeating for All 17 Hubs**

To complete the task for all 17 hubs, **repeat the above sequence 17 times**, ensuring that each hub undergoes the same set of actions. This will systematically replace all flat tyres with intact, inflated tyres while maintaining the tightness of the nuts and proper storage of all tools and flat tyres in the boot.

---

**Note:** Ensure that after each hub is processed:
- Only the tools (`wrench`, `pump`, `jack`) and the flat tyre are stored back in the boot.
- The intact tyre is inflated before moving on to the next hub.
- The boot remains in the desired state (closed) after all actions are completed for each hub.

By following this structured approach, you can efficiently and effectively replace all flat tyres with intact ones, maintaining vehicle safety and organization.
