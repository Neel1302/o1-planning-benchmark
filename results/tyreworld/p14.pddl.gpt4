Certainly, here is an optimal plan to achieve the goal:

1. "Open" the Boot.
2. "Fetch" the Jack from the Boot.
3. "Put-away" the Jack. (Just to mark it as fetched, this action should not mean the jack is no longer in possession)
4. "Fetch" the Wrench from the Boot.
5. "Put-away" the Wrench. (Again, just to mark it as fetched)
6. "Fetch" the Pump from the Boot.
7. "Put-away" the Pump. (Again, just to mark it as fetched)

This sequence should be followed 14 times (once for each wheel) starting from here:

8. "Fetch" an Intact Tyre from the Boot.
9. "Inflate" the Intact Tyre.
10. "Put-away" the Inflated Tyre.
11. "Jack-up" one of the Hubs.
12. "Loosen" the Nut on the Hub.
13. "Undo" the Nut on the Hub.
14. "Remove-wheel" the Flat Tyre from the Hub.
15. "Put-on-wheel" the Inflated Tyre on the Hub.
16. "Do-up" the Nut on the Hub.
17. "Tighten" the Nut on the Hub.
18. "Jack-down" the Hub.
19. "Fetch" the Flat Tyre.
20. "Put-away" the Flat Tyre back in the Boot.

Finally,

21. "Close" the Boot. 

This sequence of actions ensures each hub gets a new, inflated tyre, and all tools and flat tyres are stored in the boot. It operates under the assumption that an item fetched doesn't leave the agent's possession until they put it into a specific destination, hence 'putting-away' the jack, wrench and pump right after fetching them doesn't mean they lose possession of it, but are marking it as fetched.
