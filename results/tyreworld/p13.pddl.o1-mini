### **Summary of Key Actions per Hub:**
1. **Open** boot
2. **Fetch** tools and intact tyre
3. **Loosen** nut
4. **Jack-up** hub
5. **Undo** nut
6. **Remove-wheel** (remove flat tyre)
7. **Put-away** flat tyre
8. **Fetch** intact tyre
9. **Put-on-wheel** (attach intact tyre)
10. **Do-up** nut
11. **Inflate** intact tyre
12. **Tighten** nut
13. **Jack-down** hub

### **Post-Processing:**
- Ensure all tools and flat tyres are **put away** in the **boot**
- **Close** the boot

### **Notes:**
- **Sequential Processing:** Each hub must be processed one after the other to ensure that tools and equipment are managed efficiently.
- **Tool Management:** Only one set of tools (wrench, jack, pump) is needed, so fetching them once at the beginning is sufficient.
- **Boot Accessibility:** Ensure the boot remains **open** while processing each hub and **closed** only after all replacements are complete.
- **Inflation:** Inflating tyres after installation ensures they are ready for use immediately.

By following this sequence meticulously for all 13 hubs, you will successfully replace all flat tyres with intact, inflated tyres, secure all nuts tightly, store tools and flat tyres properly in the boot, and ensure the boot is closed at the end.
