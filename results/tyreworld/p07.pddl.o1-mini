   - **Precondition:** Boot is closed.
   - **Effect:** Boot is open and not closed.

2. **Put Away the Pump**
   - **Action:** `put-away pump`

5. **Put Away All 7 Flat Tyres**
   - **Action:** Repeat `put-away flat tyre` seven times, once for each flat tyre.
   - **Precondition:** Agent is holding each flat tyre and boot is open.
   - **Effect:** Flat tyres are inside the boot; agent no longer holds them.

6. **Close the Boot**
   - **Action:** `close`
   - **Precondition:** Boot is open.
   - **Effect:** Boot is closed and not open.

### **Summary of the Action List:**

1. `open`
2. `fetch pump`
3. `fetch jack`
4. `fetch wrench`
5. `fetch intact tyre` (×7)
6. `close`
7. **For each hub (1 to 7):**
   - `loosen`
   - `jack-up`
   - `remove-wheel`
   - `put-on-wheel`
   - `inflate`
   - `tighten`
   - `jack-down`
8. `open`
9. `put-away pump`
10. `put-away jack`
11. `put-away wrench`
12. `put-away flat tyre` (×7)
13. `close`

### **Notes:**

- **Fetching and Putting Away Intact Tyres:** Ensure that you fetch all 7 intact tyres before starting the replacement process. Similarly, store all flat tyres back into the boot after replacing them.
  
- **Tool Management:** The pump is used only for inflating tyres, so it's fetched once at the beginning and put away at the end. The jack and wrench are also fetched once and reused for all hubs.

- **Safety Precautions:** Always ensure that the hub is securely jacked up before removing or attaching tyres, and that the hub is firmly on the ground after tightening the nuts.

By following this sequence of actions, you will successfully replace all flat tyres with intact, inflated tyres, ensure all nuts are tight, and properly store all tools and flat tyres back into the closed boot.
