Certainly! Here's an optimal plan to achieve your goal, accounting for the constraints and actions defined:

**Initial Step:**
1. **Open the boot**
   - *Action:* `open` boot
   - *Precondition:* Boot is unlocked and closed
   - *Effect:* Boot is open

**Retrieve Tools:**
2. **Fetch the wrench**
   - *Action:* `fetch` wrench from boot
   - *Precondition:* Wrench is inside boot, boot is open
   - *Effect:* Agent holds wrench
3. **Fetch the jack**
   - *Action:* `fetch` jack from boot
   - *Precondition:* Jack is inside boot, boot is open
   - *Effect:* Agent holds jack
4. **Fetch the pump**
   - *Action:* `fetch` pump from boot
   - *Precondition:* Pump is inside boot, boot is open
   - *Effect:* Agent holds pump

**For each hub (repeat steps 5-16 for all 16 hubs):**
5. **Go to the hub**
   - *No action needed* (movement is implicit)
6. **Loosen the nut on the hub**
   - *Action:* `loosen` nut on hub
   - *Precondition:* Agent has wrench, nut on hub is tight, hub is on the ground
   - *Effect:* Nut is loose on hub
7. **Jack up the hub**
   - *Action:* `jack-up` hub
   - *Precondition:* Agent has jack, hub is on the ground
   - *Effect:* Hub is not on the ground, agent no longer has jack (jack supports hub)
8. **Undo the nut on the hub**
   - *Action:* `undo` nut on hub
   - *Precondition:* Hub is not on ground, hub is fastened, agent has wrench, nut is loose
   - *Effect:* Agent has the nut, hub is unfastened
9. **Remove the flat tyre from the hub**
   - *Action:* `remove-wheel` from hub
   - *Precondition:* Hub is not on ground, wheel is on hub, hub is unfastened
   - *Effect:* Agent has flat tyre, wheel is off the hub
10. **Put the flat tyre into the boot**
    - *Action:* `put-away` flat tyre into boot
    - *Precondition:* Agent holds flat tyre, boot is open
    - *Effect:* Flat tyre is inside boot, agent no longer holds flat tyre
11. **Fetch an intact tyre from the boot**
    - *Action:* `fetch` intact tyre from boot
    - *Precondition:* Intact tyre is inside boot, boot is open
    - *Effect:* Agent holds intact tyre
12. **Put the intact tyre onto the hub**
    - *Action:* `put-on-wheel` on hub
    - *Precondition:* Agent has wheel (intact tyre), hub is free, hub is unfastened, hub is not on ground
    - *Effect:* Wheel is on hub, hub is no longer free, agent no longer has wheel
13. **Do up the nut on the hub**
    - *Action:* `do-up` nut on hub
    - *Precondition:* Agent has wrench, hub is unfastened, hub is not on ground, agent has nut
    - *Effect:* Nut is loose on hub, hub is fastened, agent no longer has nut
14. **Jack down the hub**
    - *Action:* `jack-down` hub
    - *Precondition:* Hub is not on ground
    - *Effect:* Hub is on the ground, agent has jack
15. **Tighten the nut on the hub**
    - *Action:* `tighten` nut on hub
    - *Precondition:* Agent has wrench, nut on hub is loose, hub is on the ground
    - *Effect:* Nut is tight on hub
16. **Inflate the tyre on the hub**
    - *Action:* `inflate` tyre on hub
    - *Precondition:* Agent has pump, tyre is not inflated, tyre is intact
    - *Effect:* Tyre is inflated

**After servicing all hubs:**

17. **Put away the pump**
    - *Action:* `put-away` pump into boot
    - *Precondition:* Agent has pump, boot is open
    - *Effect:* Pump is inside boot, agent no longer has pump
18. **Put away the wrench**
    - *Action:* `put-away` wrench into boot
    - *Precondition:* Agent has wrench, boot is open
    - *Effect:* Wrench is inside boot, agent no longer has wrench
19. **Put away the jack**
    - *Action:* `put-away` jack into boot
    - *Precondition:* Agent has jack, boot is open
    - *Effect:* Jack is inside boot, agent no longer has jack

**Final Step:**

20. **Close the boot**
    - *Action:* `close` boot
    - *Precondition:* Boot is open
    - *Effect:* Boot is closed

**Notes:**

- This plan ensures that:
  - All flat tyres are replaced with intact, inflated tyres on the hubs.
  - Nuts are tight on the hubs.
  - Flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump are back in the boot.
  - The boot is closed.
- The agent efficiently uses the tools across all hubs before returning them to minimize the number of fetch and put-away actions.
- This sequence respects the constraints of the actions and optimizes the number of steps by reusing tools before putting them away.

This plan provides an optimal sequence of actions to achieve your goal while adhering to the defined action constraints in the domain.
