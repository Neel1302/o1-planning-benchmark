Sure! Below is an **optimal plan** to replace all **11 flat tyres** with **intact tyres**, ensuring that all conditions are met as per your goal. The plan is structured to handle each hub sequentially to maintain simplicity and reliability.

### **Overall Plan Structure:**

1. **Access and Prepare Tools:**
   - Open the boot.
   - Fetch all necessary tools and intact tyres.
   - Close the boot.

2. **Iterate Through Each Hub (Repeat Steps 3-12 for Hubs 1 through 11):**
   - **a. Loosen the Nut:**
     - Loosen the nut on the current hub.
   
   - **b. Jack Up the Hub:**
     - Use the jack to lift the hub off the ground.
   
   - **c. Undo the Nut:**
     - Fully remove the loosened nut from the hub.
   
   - **d. Remove the Flat Tyre:**
     - Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
   
   - **e. Store the Flat Tyre:**
     - Put the removed flat tyre into the boot.
   
   - **f. Install the Intact Tyre:**
     - Put the intact tyre onto the hub.
   
   - **g. Inflate the Intact Tyre:**
     - Use the pump to inflate the newly installed intact tyre.
   
   - **h. Tighten the Nut:**
     - Tighten the nut securely on the hub.
   
   - **i. Jack Down the Hub:**
     - Lower the hub back to the ground using the jack.

3. **Finalizing:**
   - Ensure all tools (wrench, jack, pump) and flat tyres are stored back in the boot.
   - Close the boot securely.

### **Detailed Step-by-Step Action Sequence:**

#### **1. Access and Prepare Tools:**
1. **`open`** the boot.
2. **`fetch`** the **jack** from the boot.
3. **`fetch`** the **pump** from the boot.
4. **`fetch`** the **wrench** from the boot.
5. **`fetch`** all **11 intact tyres** from the boot.
6. **`close`** the boot.

#### **2. Replace Tyres on Each Hub:**

_For **hub 1** through **hub 11**, perform the following actions sequentially:_

**For Each Hub (e.g., Hub 1):**

7. **`loosen`** the nut on **hub 1**.
8. **`jack-up`** **hub 1** using the jack.
9. **`undo`** the nut on **hub 1**.
10. **`remove-wheel`** (flat tyre) from **hub 1**.
11. **`put-away`** the removed flat tyre into the boot.
12. **`put-on-wheel`** (intact tyre) onto **hub 1**.
13. **`inflate`** the intact tyre on **hub 1** using the pump.
14. **`tighten`** the nut on **hub 1**.
15. **`jack-down`** **hub 1** to lower it back to the ground.

_Repeat steps 7-15 for each of the remaining hubs (hub 2 to hub 11)._

#### **3. Finalizing:**

16. **`open`** the boot.
17. **`put-away`** the **wrench**, **jack**, and **pump** back into the boot.
18. Ensure all **flat tyres** are already in the boot from previous steps.
19. **`close`** the boot securely.

### **Summary of Actions:**

- **Total Actions for Tools Preparation:** 6
- **Total Actions per Hub:** 9 (Loosen, Jack-Up, Undo, Remove Wheel, Put-Away Flat Tyre, Put-On Intact Tyre, Inflate, Tighten, Jack-Down)
- **Total Actions for All Hubs:** 9 actions Ã— 11 hubs = 99
- **Total Finalizing Actions:** 4

**Overall Total Actions:** 6 (Preparation) + 99 (Hubs) + 4 (Finalizing) = **109 Actions**

### **Notes:**

- **Efficiency:** While this plan handles each hub sequentially, you can optimize by handling multiple hubs simultaneously if you have additional tools or assistance.
  
- **Tool Management:** Ensure that tools are consistently stored back in the boot after each hub to maintain organization and avoid loss.

- **Safety:** Always make sure the hub is securely jacked up before removing or installing tyres to prevent accidents.

- **Inflation:** Verify that all intact tyres are properly inflated to the recommended pressure levels for optimal performance.

By following this structured and detailed plan, you will efficiently replace all flat tyres with intact, inflated tyres, secure all nuts tightly, and ensure that all tools and flat tyres are stored appropriately in the boot, which is left closed as per the goal.
