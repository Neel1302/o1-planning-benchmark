Yes, the optimal plan to solve the problem would be as follows:

1. "open" action: Open the boot.
2. "fetch" action: Fetch the jack from the boot.
3. "fetch" action: Fetch the wrench from the boot.
4. "fetch" action: Fetch the pump from the boot.
5. Loop through steps 5-16 for each of the 10 hubs.
6. "jack-up" action: Jack up the first hub.
7. "loosen" action: Loosen the nuts on the hub using the wrench.
8. "undo" action: Undo the fastening of the nut on the hub.
9. "remove-wheel" action: Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
10. "put-away" action: Put the flat tyre in the boot.
11. "fetch" action: Fetch an intact tyre from the boot.
12. "inflate" action: Inflate the intact tyre using the pump.
13. "put-on-wheel" action: Put the inflated tyre onto the hub.
14. "do-up" action: Fasten the nut onto the hub.
15. "tighten" action: Tighten the nut on the hub.
16. "jack-down" action: Lower the hub back to the ground.
17. "put-away" action: Put the jack back into the boot.
18. "put-away" action: Put the wrench back into the boot.
19. "put-away" action: Put the pump back into the boot.
20. "close" action: Close the boot.

This plan satisfies all goals: the flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres on the hubs; the nuts are tight on the hubs; the flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump are in the boot; and the boot is closed.
