1. "open" the boot.
2. "fetch" the wrench from the boot.
3. "fetch" the jack from the boot.
4. "fetch" an intact tyre from the boot.
5. "fetch" the pump from the boot.
6. "inflate" the intact tyre using the pump.
7. "put-away" the pump back to the boot.
8. "jack-up" a hub with the jack.
9. "loosen" the nuts with the wrench.
10. "undo" the fastening of the nut.
11. "remove-wheel" the flat tyre from the hub.
12. "put-away" the flat tyre into the boot.
13. "put-on-wheel" the inflated tyre onto the hub.
14. "do-up" the fastening of the nut.
15. "tighten" the nuts with the wrench.
16. "jack-down" the hub with the jack.
17. Repeat steps 4-16 for all 18 wheels.
18. "put-away" the jack into the boot.
19. "put-away" the wrench into the boot.
20. "close" the boot. 

This plan allows for the car's 18 flat tyres to be replaced and inflated, and for every object to be returned to its optimal place. It is the most efficient plan because it minimizes the number of times the boot needs to be opened and closed.
