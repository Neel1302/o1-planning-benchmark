**1. Open the boot:**
   - **Open** action.
     - *Precondition:* Boot is unlocked and closed.
     - *Effect:* Boot is open and not closed.
   - **Total actions so far:** 1

---

**2. Fetch the necessary tools and equipment:**
   - **Fetch** the wrench.
     - *Precondition:* Wrench is inside the boot and boot is open.
     - *Effect:* Agent holds the wrench; wrench is not inside the boot.
   - **Fetch** the jack.
     - *Precondition:* Jack is inside the boot and boot is open.
     - *Effect:* Agent holds the jack; jack is not inside the boot.
   - **Fetch** the pump.
     - *Precondition:* Pump is inside the boot and boot is open.
     - *Effect:* Agent holds the pump; pump is not inside the boot.
   - **Total actions so far:** 4

---

**3. For each of the 9 hubs (repeat the following steps for hubs 1 to 9):**

   **a. Fetch an intact tyre:**
      - **Fetch** the intact tyre.
        - *Precondition:* Intact tyre is inside the boot and boot is open.
        - *Effect:* Agent holds the intact tyre; intact tyre is not inside the boot.
      - **Actions per hub:** 1

   **b. Replace the tyre:**
      - **Loosen** the nut on the hub.
        - *Precondition:* Agent has wrench; nut on hub is tight; hub is on the ground.
        - *Effect:* Nut on hub is loose; nut is not tight.
      - **Jack-up** the hub.
        - *Precondition:* Agent has jack; hub is on the ground.
        - *Effect:* Hub is not on the ground; agent no longer has jack.
      - **Undo** the nut.
        - *Precondition:* Agent has wrench; nut is loose; hub is not on the ground; hub is fastened.
        - *Effect:* Agent has nut; hub is unfastened; hub is not loose; hub is not fastened.
      - **Remove-wheel** (flat tyre):
        - *Precondition:* Agent has wrench; hub is unfastened; hub is not on the ground; wheel is on hub.
        - *Effect:* Agent has flat tyre; hub is free; wheel is not on hub.
      - **Put-on-wheel** (intact tyre):
        - *Precondition:* Agent has intact tyre; hub is free; hub is unfastened; hub is not on the ground.
        - *Effect:* Wheel is on hub; hub is not free; agent no longer has intact tyre.
      - **Do-up** the nut:
        - *Precondition:* Agent has wrench; agent has nut; hub is unfastened; hub is not on the ground.
        - *Effect:* Nut is loose on hub; hub is fastened; agent no longer has nut.
      - **Jack-down** the hub:
        - *Precondition:* Hub is not on the ground.
        - *Effect:* Hub is on the ground; agent has jack.
      - **Tighten** the nut:
        - *Precondition:* Agent has wrench; nut on hub is loose; hub is on the ground.
        - *Effect:* Nut on hub is tight; nut is not loose.
      - **Inflate** the tyre:
        - *Precondition:* Agent has pump; wheel is intact; wheel is not inflated.
        - *Effect:* Wheel is inflated.
      - **Actions per hub:** 9

   - **Total actions per hub:** 10 (1 fetch + 9 steps)
   - **Total actions after all hubs:** 4 (initial) + 9 hubs *10 actions/hub = **94 actions**

---

**4. Put away the flat tyres and tools:**
   - **Put-away** the 9 flat tyres.
     - *Precondition:* Agent has flat tyre; boot is open.
     - *Effect:* Flat tyre is inside the boot; agent no longer has flat tyre.
     - **Actions:** 9 (one for each flat tyre)
   - **Put-away** the wrench.
     - *Precondition:* Agent has wrench; boot is open.
     - *Effect:* Wrench is inside the boot; agent no longer has wrench.
   - **Put-away** the jack.
     - *Precondition:* Agent has jack; boot is open.
     - *Effect:* Jack is inside the boot; agent no longer has jack.
   - **Put-away** the pump.
     - *Precondition:* Agent has pump; boot is open.
     - *Effect:* Pump is inside the boot; agent no longer has pump.
   - **Total actions for putting away items:** 12

---

**5. Close the boot:**
   - **Close** action.
     - *Precondition:* Boot is open.
     - *Effect:* Boot is closed and not open.
   - **Total actions so far:** 107

---

**Total actions in the plan:** 1 (open boot) + 3 (fetch tools) + 90 (9 hubs *10 actions per hub) + 12 (put away items) + 1 (close boot) = **107 actions**

**Summary of the Optimal Plan:**

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch wrench.
3. Fetch jack.
4. Fetch pump.
5. For each hub (1 to 9):
   - Fetch intact tyre.
   - Loosen the nut.
   - Jack up the hub.
   - Undo the nut.
   - Remove the flat tyre.
   - Put on the intact tyre.
   - Do up the nut.
   - Jack down the hub.
   - Tighten the nut.
   - Inflate the tyre.
6. Put away the 9 flat tyres.
7. Put away the wrench, jack, and pump.
8. Close the boot.

This plan efficiently replaces all the flat tyres with intact, inflated tyres on the hubs, ensures that the nuts are tight, the flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump are back in the boot, and the boot is closedâ€”all while minimizing the total number of actions to 107.
