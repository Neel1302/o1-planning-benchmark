1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the jack, the wrench, the pump, and one intact tyre from the boot.
3. Inflate the intact tyre using the pump.
4. Select one hub with a flat tyre.
5. Use the jack to jack-up the selected hub.
6. Use the wrench to loosen the nut on the hub.
7. Undo the fastening of the nut with the wrench.
8. Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
9. Put on the inflated tyre onto the hub.
10. Do-up the fastening of the nut with the wrench.
11. Tighten the nut on the hub with the wrench.
12. Use the jack to jack-down the selected hub.
13. Put-away the flat tyre, the pump, the wrench, and the jack in the boot.
14. Close the boot.
15. Repeat steps 2 to 14 for the remaining 19 hubs.

This plan makes sure that each tyre is properly replaced and inflated one-by-one, and all required tools and replaced tyres are put back to the boot in each iteration, to minimize the risk of having a tool missing when it is needed.
