Certainly! Below is an **optimal sequence of actions** to replace the 5 flat tyres with intact tyres, ensure the intact tyres are inflated, tighten the nuts, and return all tools and flat tyres to the boot, keeping it closed. This plan processes each hub sequentially while efficiently managing the tools and objects.

### **Initial Setup:**
- **Boot Status:** Unlocked and closed.
- **Contents in Boot:** Jack, pump, wrench, 5 intact tyres (not inflated), 5 flat tyres on hubs.
- **Hubs:** All on the ground with tight nuts and fastened.

### **Optimal Plan:**

1. **Open the Boot:**
   - **Action:** `open`

2. **Fetch Necessary Tools and Intact Tyres:**
   - **Action:** `fetch wrench`
   - **Action:** `fetch jack`
   - **Action:** `fetch pump`
   - **Action:** `fetch intact tyre`

3. **Close the Boot:**
   - **Action:** `close`

4. **Repeat the Following Steps for Each of the 5 Hubs:**

   **For Hub 1 to Hub 5:**

   a. **Prepare to Remove the Flat Tyre:**
      - **Action:** `fetch nut` *(Assuming fetching the specific nut for the current hub)*

   b. **Loosen the Nut on the Hub:**
      - **Action:** `loosen`

   c. **Lift the Hub Off the Ground:**
      - **Action:** `jack-up`

   d. **Undo the Nut Completely:**
      - **Action:** `undo`

   e. **Remove the Flat Tyre from the Hub:**
      - **Action:** `remove-wheel`

   f. **Store the Flat Tyre Back in the Boot:**
      - **Action:** `open`
      - **Action:** `put-away flat tyre`
      - **Action:** `close`

   g. **Remove and Store the Nut:**
      - **Action:** `put-away nut`

   h. **Attach the Intact Tyre to the Hub:**
      - **Action:** `put-on-wheel`

   i. **Fasten the Nut to Secure the Intact Tyre:**
      - **Action:** `do-up`

   j. **Tighten the Nut to Ensure It's Secure:**
      - **Action:** `tighten`

   k. **Inflate the Intact Tyre:**
      - **Action:** `inflate`

   l. **Lower the Hub Back to the Ground:**
      - **Action:** `jack-down`

5. **After Replacing All Hubs, Return Tools to the Boot:**

   a. **Store the Wrench:**
      - **Action:** `open`
      - **Action:** `put-away wrench`

   b. **Store the Jack:**
      - **Action:** `put-away jack`

   c. **Store the Pump:**
      - **Action:** `put-away pump`

   d. **Ensure All Tools and Flat Tyres Are in the Boot:**
      - *(Assuming all flat tyres have been put away in step 4f)*

6. **Close the Boot to Finalize the Task:**
   - **Action:** `close`

### **Summary of Actions:**

1. `open`
2. `fetch wrench`
3. `fetch jack`
4. `fetch pump`
5. `fetch intact tyre`
6. `close`
7. Repeat the following for each hub (5 times):
   - `fetch nut`
   - `loosen`
   - `jack-up`
   - `undo`
   - `remove-wheel`
   - `open`
   - `put-away flat tyre`
   - `close`
   - `put-away nut`
   - `put-on-wheel`
   - `do-up`
   - `tighten`
   - `inflate`
   - `jack-down`
8. `open`
9. `put-away wrench`
10. `put-away jack`
11. `put-away pump`
12. `close`

### **Notes:**

- **Tool Management:** Tools like the wrench, jack, and pump are fetched once and reused for all hubs to minimize actions.
- **Object Placement:** Flat tyres are stored back in the boot immediately after removal to keep the workspace organized.
- **Inflation:** Each intact tyre is inflated right after being mounted to ensure it's ready for use.
- **Boot Security:** The boot is closed after initial fetching and after all tools and tyres are stored, ensuring it remains secure throughout the process.

This sequence ensures that all preconditions are met before each action and that the effects of each action contribute towards achieving the final goal efficiently.
