Here is an optimal plan of actions to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the jack from the boot.
3. Fetch the wrench from the boot.
4. Fetch the pump from the boot.
5. Fetch an intact tyre from the boot.
6. Inflate the intact tyre with the pump.
7. Put away the pump into the boot.
8. Jack up the first hub.
9. Loosen the nut on the hub using the wrench.
10. Undo the fastened hub with the wrench.
11. Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
12. Put on the inflated intact tyre on the hub.
13. Do up the hub with the nut using the wrench.
14. Tighten the nut on the hub using the wrench.
15. Jack down the hub.
16. Put away the flat tyre into the boot.
17. Repeat step 2 to step 16 for remaining 5 tyres.
18. Fetch the jack from the boot.
19. Fetch the wrench from the boot.
20. Fetch the pump from the boot.
21. Put away the wrench into the boot.
22. Put away the jack into the boot.
23. Put away the pump into the boot.
24. Close the boot.

Thus, now, the flat tyres are replaced with intact tyres on the hubs, intact tyres are inflated, the nuts are tight on the hubs, the flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump are in the boot, and the boot is closed, which was our end goal.
