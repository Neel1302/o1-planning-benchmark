Certainly! Below is an **optimal sequence of actions** to replace all flat tyres with intact, inflated tyres on the hubs while ensuring that all tools and flat tyres are stored back in the boot correctly. This plan minimizes the number of open and close operations on the boot by fetching all necessary tools and tyres at the beginning and storing flat tyres immediately after removal.

### **Overall Plan Overview**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Open the boot.
   - Fetch all necessary tools and intact tyres.
   - Close the boot.

2. **Per Hub Replacement (Repeated for Each of the 10 Hubs):**
   - Loosen the nut on the hub.
   - Jack up the hub.
   - Remove the flat tyre.
   - Store the flat tyre in the boot.
   - Put the intact tyre onto the hub.
   - Inflate the intact tyre.
   - Tighten the nut on the hub.
   - Jack down the hub.

3. **Finalization:**
   - Ensure all tools are stored back in the boot.
   - Close the boot.

   - **Preconditions:** Boot is open.
   - **Effects:** Boot is closed.

10. **Put On Intact Tyre onto Hub 1**
    - **Action:** `put-on-wheel intact_tyre1`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent holds Intact Tyre 1, Hub 1 is free and unfastened, and Hub 1 is not on the ground.
    - **Effects:** Intact Tyre 1 is on Hub 1. Hub 1 is not free. Agent no longer holds Intact Tyre 1.

11. **Inflate Intact Tyre on Hub 1**
    - **Action:** `inflate`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent has a pump, Intact Tyre 1 is not inflated, and it is intact.
    - **Effects:** Intact Tyre 1 is inflated.

12. **Tighten Nut on Hub 1**
    - **Action:** `tighten`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent has a wrench, nut on Hub 1 is loose, and Hub 1 is on the ground.

13. **Jack Down Hub 1**
    - **Action:** `jack-down`
    - **Preconditions:** Hub 1 is elevated.
    - **Effects:** Hub 1 is back on the ground. Agent has the jack.

*Repeat **Steps 4 to 13** for **Hub 2** through **Hub 10**, substituting the hub and tyre identifiers accordingly (e.g., `loosen` for Hub 2, `remove-wheel` for Hub 2, `put-on-wheel intact_tyre2`, etc.).*

### **Summary of Actions**

Here's a condensed list of all actions in order:

1. `open`
2. `fetch wrench`
3. `fetch pump`
4. `fetch jack`
5. `fetch intact_tyre1`
6. `fetch intact_tyre2`
7. `...` *(Continue fetching all intact tyres up to intact_tyre10)*
8. `close`

*For each Hub (1 to 10):*

9. `loosen`
10. `jack-up`
11. `remove-wheel`
12. `open`
13. `put-away flat_tyreX` *(where X is hub number)*
14. `close`
15. `put-on-wheel intact_tyreX`
16. `inflate`
17. `tighten`
18. `jack-down`

*After all Hubs:*

19. `open`
20. `put-away wrench`
21. `put-away pump`
22. `put-away jack`
23. `close`

### **Notes:**

- **Batch Fetching:** Fetch all intact tyres at the beginning to minimize the number of `open` and `close` operations.
  
- **Tool Management:** Keep the tools (`wrench`, `pump`, `jack`) in hand during all hub replacements to avoid fetching and putting them away multiple times.
  
- **Boot Operations:** Only open the boot twiceâ€”once at the beginning to fetch tools and tyres, and once at the end to store the tools. Flat tyres are stored immediately after removal to maintain organization.

- **Inflation:** Ensure the pump is readily accessible while inflating each intact tyre.

This plan ensures that all objectives are met efficiently, with minimal redundant actions. By batching tool retrieval and storage, and systematically replacing each tyre, the sequence remains optimal.
