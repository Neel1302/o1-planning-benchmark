Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to replace flat tyres with intact tyres on all 20 hubs, ensuring that intact tyres are inflated, nuts are tight, and all necessary tools and flat tyres are stored back in the boot with the boot closed at the end. The plan is structured to handle one hub at a time and can be repeated for each of the 20 hubs.

### **General Steps for Each Hub:**

1. **Open the Boot:**
   - **Action:** `open`
   - **Preconditions:** Boot is unlocked and closed.
   - **Effects:** Boot is open and not closed.

2. **Fetch Necessary Tools and Tyres:**
   - **Actions:**
     - `fetch` wrench
     - `fetch` jack
     - `fetch` pump
     - `fetch` intact tyre
   - **Preconditions:** Each object is inside the open boot.
   - **Effects:** Agent holds the wrench, jack, pump, and an intact tyre; objects are no longer inside the boot.

3. **Close the Boot:**
   - **Action:** `close`
   - **Preconditions:** Boot is open.
   - **Effects:** Boot is closed and not open.

4. **Loosen the Nuts on the Current (Flat) Tyre:**
   - **Action:** `loosen`
   - **Preconditions:** Agent has a wrench, nuts on the hub are tight, and the hub is on the ground.
   - **Effects:** Nuts on the hub are loose and not tight.

5. **Jack Up the Hub:**
   - **Action:** `jack-up`
   - **Preconditions:** Agent has a jack and the hub is on the ground.
   - **Effects:** Hub is lifted off the ground and the agent no longer has the jack.

6. **Undo the Fastening of the Nuts:**
   - **Action:** `undo`
   - **Preconditions:** Hub is not on the ground, nuts are loose, hub is fastened, and agent has a wrench.
   - **Effects:** Agent holds the nuts, hub is unfastened, and hub is no longer fastened or loose.

7. **Remove the Flat Tyre:**
   - **Action:** `remove-wheel`
   - **Preconditions:** Hub is not on the ground, flat tyre is on the hub, and hub is unfastened.
   - **Effects:** Agent holds the removed flat tyre, and the hub is free.

8. **Store the Flat Tyre Back in the Boot:**
   - **Action:** `put-away` (for flat tyre)
   - **Preconditions:** Agent holds the flat tyre and the boot is closed.
   - **Effects:** Flat tyre is inside the boot and not held by the agent.

9. **Put the Intact Tyre Onto the Hub:**
   - **Action:** `put-on-wheel`
   - **Preconditions:** Agent has an intact tyre, hub is free, hub is unfastened, and hub is not on the ground.
   - **Effects:** Intact tyre is on the hub, hub is no longer free, and agent no longer has the intact tyre.

10. **Fasten the Nuts with the Intact Tyre:**
    - **Action:** `do-up`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent has a wrench, hub is unfastened, hub is not on the ground, and agent has the nut.
    - **Effects:** Nuts are now loose on the hub, hub is fastened, and agent no longer has the nut.

11. **Lower the Hub Back to the Ground:**
    - **Action:** `jack-down`
    - **Preconditions:** Hub is not on the ground.
    - **Effects:** Hub is back on the ground and agent has the jack.

12. **Tighten the Nuts Securely:**
    - **Action:** `tighten`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent has a wrench, nuts on the hub are loose, and hub is on the ground.
    - **Effects:** Nuts on the hub are tight and not loose.

13. **Inflate the Intact Tyre:**
    - **Action:** `inflate`
    - **Preconditions:** Agent has a pump, intact tyre is not inflated, and intact tyre is intact.
    - **Effects:** Intact tyre is inflated.

14. **Store Tools Back in the Boot:**
    - **Actions:**
      - `open` (if needed)
      - `put-away` wrench
      - `put-away` jack
      - `put-away` pump
    - **Preconditions:** Agent holds the tools and boot is accessible.
    - **Effects:** Tools are inside the boot and not held by the agent.

15. **Ensure the Boot is Closed:**
    - **Action:** `close`
    - **Preconditions:** Boot is open (if it was opened to store tools).
    - **Effects:** Boot is closed and not open.

### **Loop Through All 20 Hubs:**

Repeat the above steps **20 times**, once for each hub that has a flat tyre. Ensure that after each iteration:

- The flat tyre is stored back in the boot.
- The intact tyre is inflated and securely fastened.
- All tools are returned to the boot.
- The boot remains closed after each tyre replacement.

### **Summary of Actions for One Hub:**

1. `open`
2. `fetch` wrench
3. `fetch` jack
4. `fetch` pump
5. `fetch` intact tyre
6. `close`
7. `loosen`
8. `jack-up`
9. `undo`
10. `remove-wheel`
11. `put-away` flat tyre
12. `put-on-wheel` intact tyre
13. `do-up`
14. `jack-down`
15. `tighten`
16. `inflate`
17. `open` (if needed for storing tools)
18. `put-away` wrench
19. `put-away` jack
20. `put-away` pump
21. `close`

**Note:** Steps 17 to 21 ensure that all tools are stored back in the boot and the boot is closed, maintaining the desired final state after each tyre replacement.

### **Final State After Completing All 20 Hubs:**

- **All 20 intact tyres** are on the hubs and **inflated**.
- **All nuts** are **tightened** on the hubs.
- **All flat tyres**, **wrench**, **jack**, and **pump** are **stored back in the boot**.
- The **boot is closed**.

By following this plan iteratively for each hub, you will efficiently replace all flat tyres with intact ones, ensuring safety and maintaining organization of your tools and spare tyres.
