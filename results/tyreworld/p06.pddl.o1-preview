To solve the problem optimally, we will outline a step-by-step plan that minimizes the number of actions while adhering to the action definitions provided. Here's the optimal plan:

**1. Open the Boot**
- **Action**: `open(boot)`
  - *Precondition*: Boot is unlocked and closed.
  - *Effect*: Boot is open and not closed.

**2. Fetch Tools and Intact Tyres**
- **Actions**:
  1. `fetch(wrench)`
  2. `fetch(jack)`
  3. `fetch(pump)`
  4. `fetch(intact_tyre1)`
  5. `fetch(intact_tyre2)`
  6. `fetch(intact_tyre3)`
  7. `fetch(intact_tyre4)`
  8. `fetch(intact_tyre5)`
  9. `fetch(intact_tyre6)`
  - *Precondition for each fetch*: Object is inside the boot (container), and the boot is open.
  - *Effect for each fetch*: Object is held by the agent and not inside the boot.

**3. Inflate Intact Tyres**
- **Actions**:
  1. `inflate(intact_tyre1)`
  2. `inflate(intact_tyre2)`
  3. `inflate(intact_tyre3)`
  4. `inflate(intact_tyre4)`
  5. `inflate(intact_tyre5)`
  6. `inflate(intact_tyre6)`
  - *Precondition for each inflate*: Agent has pump, tyre is intact and not inflated.
  - *Effect for each inflate*: Tyre is inflated.

**4. Replace Tyres on Each Hub (Repeat for Hubs 1 to 6)**
For each hub (let's denote the hub as `hubX` and corresponding tyres and nuts):

- **Loosen the Nut**
  - **Action**: `loosen(nutX)`
    - *Precondition*: Agent has wrench, nut on hub is tight, hub is on the ground.
    - *Effect*: Nut on hub is loose and not tight.

- **Jack Up the Hub**
  - **Action**: `jack-up(hubX)`
    - *Precondition*: Agent has jack, hub is on the ground.
    - *Effect*: Hub is not on the ground, agent no longer has the jack.

- **Undo the Nut**
  - **Action**: `undo(nutX)`
    - *Precondition*: Hub is not on the ground, hub is fastened, agent has wrench, nut is loose.
    - *Effect*: Agent has the nut, hub is unfastened, nut is not loose, hub is not fastened.

- **Remove the Flat Tyre**
  - **Action**: `remove-wheel(flat_tyreX, hubX)`
    - *Precondition*: Hub not on ground, wheel is on hub, hub is unfastened.
    - *Effect*: Agent has the flat tyre, hub is free, wheel is not on hub.

- **Put On the Inflated Intact Tyre**
  - **Action**: `put-on-wheel(intact_tyreX, hubX)`
    - *Precondition*: Agent has the wheel, hub is free, hub is unfastened, hub is not on the ground.
    - *Effect*: Wheel is on hub, hub is not free, agent no longer has the wheel.

- **Do Up the Nut**
  - **Action**: `do-up(nutX)`
    - *Precondition*: Agent has wrench, hub is unfastened, hub is not on the ground, agent has the nut.
    - *Effect*: Nut is now loose on the hub, hub is fastened, hub is not unfastened, agent no longer has the nut.

- **Jack Down the Hub**
  - **Action**: `jack-down(hubX)`
    - *Precondition*: Hub is not on the ground.
    - *Effect*: Hub is on the ground, agent has the jack.

- **Tighten the Nut**
  - **Action**: `tighten(nutX)`
    - *Precondition*: Agent has wrench, nut is loose, hub is on the ground.
    - *Effect*: Nut is tight, nut is not loose.

**5. Put Away Flat Tyres and Tools**
- **Actions**:
  1. `put-away(flat_tyre1)`
  2. `put-away(flat_tyre2)`
  3. `put-away(flat_tyre3)`
  4. `put-away(flat_tyre4)`
  5. `put-away(flat_tyre5)`
  6. `put-away(flat_tyre6)`
  7. `put-away(wrench)`
  8. `put-away(jack)`
  9. `put-away(pump)`
  - *Precondition for each put-away*: Object is held by agent, boot is open.
  - *Effect for each put-away*: Object is inside boot, object is no longer held by agent.

**6. Close the Boot**
- **Action**: `close(boot)`
  - *Precondition*: Boot is open.
  - *Effect*: Boot is closed and not open.

**Summary of Actions**:

1. `open(boot)`
2. `fetch(wrench)`
3. `fetch(jack)`
4. `fetch(pump)`
5. `fetch(intact_tyre1)`
6. `fetch(intact_tyre2)`
7. `fetch(intact_tyre3)`
8. `fetch(intact_tyre4)`
9. `fetch(intact_tyre5)`
10. `fetch(intact_tyre6)`
11. `inflate(intact_tyre1)`
12. `inflate(intact_tyre2)`
13. `inflate(intact_tyre3)`
14. `inflate(intact_tyre4)`
15. `inflate(intact_tyre5)`
16. `inflate(intact_tyre6)`

For Hubs 1 to 6 (Repeat the following sequence for each hubX):

17. `loosen(nutX)`
18. `jack-up(hubX)`
19. `undo(nutX)`
20. `remove-wheel(flat_tyreX, hubX)`
21. `put-on-wheel(intact_tyreX, hubX)`
22. `do-up(nutX)`
23. `jack-down(hubX)`
24. `tighten(nutX)`

(After all hubs are processed)

65. `put-away(flat_tyre1)`
66. `put-away(flat_tyre2)`
67. `put-away(flat_tyre3)`
68. `put-away(flat_tyre4)`
69. `put-away(flat_tyre5)`
70. `put-away(flat_tyre6)`
71. `put-away(wrench)`
72. `put-away(jack)`
73. `put-away(pump)`
74. `close(boot)`

This plan ensures that all flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres on the hubs, the nuts are tight, and all flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump are returned to the boot, which is then closed. The sequence minimizes the number of actions by fetching all tools and tyres at once, inflating all tyres together, and processing each hub sequentially without unnecessary repetitions.
