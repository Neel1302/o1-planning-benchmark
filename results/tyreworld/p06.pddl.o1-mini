5. **Open the Boot to Store Flat Tyres**
   - **Action:** `open`
   - **Preconditions:** Boot is closed and unlocked.
   - **Effects:** Boot is open.

6. **Replace Flat Tyres with Intact Tyres on Each Hub**
   
   For **each hub (1 through 6)**, perform the following sequence:

   a. **Loosen the Nut on the Hub**
      - **Action:** `loosen`
      - **Preconditions:** Agent has the wrench, the nut on Hub `n` is tight, and Hub `n` is on the ground.
      - **Effects:** Nut on Hub `n` is loose.

   b. **Jack Up the Hub**
      - **Action:** `jack-up`
      - **Preconditions:** Agent has the jack, and Hub `n` is on the ground.
      - **Effects:** Hub `n` is jacked up (not on the ground), and the agent no longer has the jack.

   c. **Remove the Flat Tyre from the Hub**
      - **Action:** `remove-wheel`
      - **Preconditions:** Hub `n` is not on the ground, the flat tyre is on Hub `n`, and Hub `n` is unfastened.
      - **Effects:** Flat Tyre `n` is held by the agent, and Hub `n` is free.

   d. **Store the Flat Tyre in the Boot**
      - **Action:** `put-away flat_tyre_n`
      - **Preconditions:** Agent has Flat Tyre `n` and the boot is open.
      - **Effects:** Flat Tyre `n` is inside the boot, and the agent no longer holds it.

   e. **Put the Intact Tyre onto the Hub**
      - **Action:** `put-on-wheel intact_tyre_n`
      - **Preconditions:** Agent has Intact Tyre `n`, Hub `n` is free, Hub `n` is unfastened, and Hub `n` is not on the ground.
      - **Effects:** Intact Tyre `n` is on Hub `n`, Hub `n` is no longer free, and the agent no longer holds Intact Tyre `n`.

   f. **Jack Down the Hub**
      - **Action:** `jack-down`
      - **Preconditions:** Hub `n` is off the ground.
      - **Effects:** Hub `n` is back on the ground, and the agent has the jack.

   g. **Tighten the Nut on the Hub**
      - **Action:** `tighten`
      - **Preconditions:** Agent has the wrench, the nut on Hub `n` is loose, and Hub `n` is on the ground.
      - **Effects:** Nut on Hub `n` is tight.

7. **Store Tools Back into the Boot**
   
   After replacing all tyres, store the tools back into the boot:

   - **Action:** `put-away pump`
     - **Preconditions:** Agent has the pump and the boot is open.
     - **Effects:** Pump is inside the boot, and the agent no longer holds it.
   
   - **Action:** `put-away wrench`
     - **Preconditions:** Agent has the wrench and the boot is open.
     - **Effects:** Wrench is inside the boot, and the agent no longer holds it.
   
   - **Action:** `put-away jack`
     - **Preconditions:** Agent has the jack and the boot is open.
     - **Effects:** Jack is inside the boot, and the agent no longer holds it.

8. **Close the Boot**
   - **Action:** `close`
   - **Preconditions:** Boot is open.
   - **Effects:** Boot is closed.

### **Summary of the Plan**

1. **Open** the boot.
2. **Fetch** the pump, wrench, jack, and all six intact tyres from the boot.
3. **Close** the boot.
4. **Inflate** each of the six intact tyres using the pump.
5. **Open** the boot to prepare for storing flat tyres.
6. **For each of the six hubs**:
   - **Loosen** the nut.
   - **Jack up** the hub.
   - **Remove** the flat tyre.
   - **Store** the flat tyre in the boot.
   - **Install** the inflated intact tyre onto the hub.
   - **Jack down** the hub.
   - **Tighten** the nut.
7. **Store** the pump, wrench, and jack back into the boot.
8. **Close** the boot.

### **Final State Achieved**

- All six flat tyres have been replaced with inflated intact tyres on their respective hubs.
- Nuts on all hubs are tight.
- Flat tyres, pump, wrench, and jack are stored in the closed boot.

This sequence ensures that all actions meet their preconditions and achieve the desired effects efficiently. Repeating the hub replacement steps sequentially ensures that each tyre is properly handled without conflict.
