An optimal plan to solve the problem is as follows:

1. **Open the boot**.
   - Action: `open(boot)`
   - Precondition: `boot is unlocked and closed`
   - Effect: `boot is open and not closed`

2. **Fetch the wrench from the boot**.
   - Action: `fetch(wrench, boot)`
   - Precondition: `wrench is inside boot` and `boot is open`
   - Effect: `agent has wrench` and `wrench not inside boot`

3. **Fetch the jack from the boot**.
   - Action: `fetch(jack, boot)`
   - Precondition: `jack is inside boot` and `boot is open`
   - Effect: `agent has jack` and `jack not inside boot`

4. **Fetch the pump from the boot**.
   - Action: `fetch(pump, boot)`
   - Precondition: `pump is inside boot` and `boot is open`
   - Effect: `agent has pump` and `pump not inside boot`

Then, for each of the **8 hubs** (repeat steps 5 to 15 for each hub):

5. **Fetch the intact tyre from the boot**.
   - Action: `fetch(intact_tyre, boot)`
   - Precondition: `intact_tyre is inside boot` and `boot is open`
   - Effect: `agent has intact_tyre` and `intact_tyre not inside boot`

6. **Inflate the intact tyre**.
   - Action: `inflate(intact_tyre)`
   - Precondition: `agent has pump`, `agent has intact_tyre`, `intact_tyre is not inflated`, and `intact_tyre is intact`
   - Effect: `intact_tyre is inflated`

7. **Loosen the nut on the hub**.
   - Action: `loosen(nut, hub)`
   - Precondition: `agent has wrench`, `nut on hub is tight`, and `hub is on ground`
   - Effect: `nut on hub is loose` and `nut on hub not tight`

8. **Jack up the hub**.
   - Action: `jack-up(hub)`
   - Precondition: `agent has jack` and `hub is on ground`
   - Effect: `hub not on ground` and `agent no longer has jack`

9. **Undo the nut on the hub**.
   - Action: `undo(nut, hub)`
   - Precondition: `hub not on ground`, `nut on hub is loose`, `agent has wrench`, and `hub is fastened`
   - Effect: `agent has nut`, `hub is unfastened`, `nut on hub not loose`, and `hub not fastened`

10. **Remove the flat tyre from the hub**.
    - Action: `remove-wheel(flat_tyre, hub)`
    - Precondition: `hub not on ground`, `flat_tyre is on hub`, and `hub is unfastened`
    - Effect: `agent has flat_tyre`, `flat_tyre not on hub`, and `hub is free`

11. **Put away the flat tyre into the boot**.
    - Action: `put-away(flat_tyre, boot)`
    - Precondition: `agent has flat_tyre` and `boot is open`
    - Effect: `flat_tyre is inside boot` and `agent no longer has flat_tyre`

12. **Put on the inflated intact tyre on the hub**.
    - Action: `put-on-wheel(intact_tyre, hub)`
    - Precondition: `agent has inflated intact_tyre`, `hub is free`, `hub is unfastened`, and `hub not on ground`
    - Effect: `intact_tyre is on hub`, `hub not free`, and `agent no longer has intact_tyre`

13. **Do up the nut on the hub**.
    - Action: `do-up(nut, hub)`
    - Precondition: `agent has nut`, `hub is unfastened`, `hub not on ground`, and `agent has wrench`
    - Effect: `nut on hub is loose`, `hub is fastened`, `hub not unfastened`, and `agent no longer has nut`

14. **Jack down the hub**.
    - Action: `jack-down(hub)`
    - Precondition: `hub not on ground`
    - Effect: `hub is on ground` and `agent has jack`

15. **Tighten the nut on the hub**.
    - Action: `tighten(nut, hub)`
    - Precondition: `agent has wrench`, `nut on hub is loose`, and `hub is on ground`
    - Effect: `nut on hub is tight` and `nut on hub not loose`

After all hubs are processed:

16. **Put away the pump into the boot**.
    - Action: `put-away(pump, boot)`
    - Precondition: `agent has pump` and `boot is open`
    - Effect: `pump is inside boot` and `agent no longer has pump`

17. **Put away the wrench into the boot**.
    - Action: `put-away(wrench, boot)`
    - Precondition: `agent has wrench` and `boot is open`
    - Effect: `wrench is inside boot` and `agent no longer has wrench`

18. **Put away the jack into the boot**.
    - Action: `put-away(jack, boot)`
    - Precondition: `agent has jack` and `boot is open`
    - Effect: `jack is inside boot` and `agent no longer has jack`

19. **Close the boot**.
    - Action: `close(boot)`
    - Precondition: `boot is open`
    - Effect: `boot is closed` and `boot not open`

This plan achieves the goal state by:

- Replacing each flat tyre with an inflated intact tyre on the hubs.
- Ensuring that the intact tyres are inflated.
- Making sure the nuts are tight on the hubs.
- Placing all flat tyres, the wrench, the jack, and the pump back into the boot.
- Closing the boot at the end.

This plan is optimal because it minimizes the total number of actions by reusing tools across all hubs and eliminating unnecessary steps.
