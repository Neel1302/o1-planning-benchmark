Yes, the following plan describes the necessary actions to solve the problem:

1. "open" action on the boot.

2. "fetch" action on the jack from the boot.

3. "fetch" action on the wrench from the boot.

4. Repeat the following steps (4 to 12) twelve times, once for each hub and corresponding tyre:

4. "fetch" action on a intact tyre from the boot.

5. "jack-up" action on the hub.

6. "loosen" action on the nut on the hub.

7. "undo" action on the tightened nut on the hub.

8. "remove-wheel" action on the flat tyre from the hub.

9. "put-away" action on the flat tyre into the boot.

10. "put-on-wheel" action on the intact tyre onto the hub.

11. "do-up" action on the nut onto the hub in order to secure the new tyre.

12. "jack-down" action on the hub.

5. "fetch" action on the pump from the boot.

6. Repeat the following steps (6 to 7) twelve times, once for each intact tyre:

6. "inflate" action on the intact tyre with the pump.

7. "put-away" action on the intact tyre into the boot.

8. "put-away" action on the pump.

9. "put-away" action on the wrench.
