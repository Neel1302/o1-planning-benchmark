Certainly! Below is an **optimal sequence of actions** to replace the flat tyres with intact ones, inflate them, ensure the nuts are tight on the hubs, and store all necessary items back in the boot. This plan is structured to minimize the number of actions by fetching tools and intact tyres upfront and handling each hub systematically.

### **Step-by-Step Plan:**

1. **Open the Boot**
   - **Action:** `open`
   - *Precondition:* Boot is unlocked and closed.
   - *Effect:* Boot is open.

2. **Fetch Tools and Intact Tyres**
   - **Action:** `fetch wrench`
   - **Action:** `fetch jack`
   - **Action:** `fetch pump`
   - **Action:** `fetch intact_tyre_1`
   - **Action:** `fetch intact_tyre_2`
   - **Action:** `fetch intact_tyre_3`
   - **Action:** `fetch intact_tyre_4`
   - **Action:** `fetch intact_tyre_5`
   - **Action:** `fetch intact_tyre_6`
   - **Action:** `fetch intact_tyre_7`
   - **Action:** `fetch intact_tyre_8`
   - *Precondition for each `fetch`:* Object is inside the boot and boot is open.
   - *Effect for each `fetch`:* Object is held by the agent and no longer in the boot.

3. **Close the Boot After Fetching**
   - **Action:** `close`
   - *Precondition:* Boot is open.
   - *Effect:* Boot is closed.

4. **Process Each Hub (Repeat Steps 5-16 for Hubs 1 to 8)**

   For **each hub**, perform the following actions in order:

   5. **Loosen the Nuts on the Hub**
      - **Action:** `loosen`
      - *Preconditions:* Agent has a wrench, nuts on hub are tight, hub is on the ground.
      - *Effect:* Nuts on hub are loose.

   6. **Jack Up the Hub**
      - **Action:** `jack-up`
      - *Preconditions:* Agent has a jack, hub is on the ground.
      - *Effect:* Hub is lifted off the ground, jack is no longer held by the agent.

   7. **Undo the Fastened Nuts**
      - **Action:** `undo`
      - *Preconditions:* Hub is jacked up (not on the ground), nuts are loose, agent has a wrench.
      - *Effect:* Nuts are removed from the hub, agent holds the nuts.

   8. **Remove the Flat Tyre from the Hub**
      - **Action:** `remove-wheel`
      - *Preconditions:* Hub is jacked up, nuts are undone, flat tyre is on the hub, hub is unfastened.
      - *Effect:* Flat tyre is removed and held by the agent, hub is free.

   9. **Open the Boot to Store the Flat Tyre**
      - **Action:** `open`
      - *Preconditions:* Boot is closed.
      - *Effect:* Boot is open.

   10. **Put Away the Flat Tyre in the Boot**
       - **Action:** `put-away`
       - *Preconditions:* Agent is holding the flat tyre, boot is open.
       - *Effect:* Flat tyre is inside the boot, agent no longer holds it.

   11. **Close the Boot After Storing the Flat Tyre**
       - **Action:** `close`
       - *Precondition:* Boot is open.
       - *Effect:* Boot is closed.

   12. **Put the Intact Tyre on the Hub**
       - **Action:** `put-on-wheel`
       - *Preconditions:* Agent holds the intact tyre, hub is free, hub is unfastened, hub is jacked up.
       - *Effect:* Intact tyre is on the hub, hub is no longer free, agent no longer holds the tyre.

   13. **Inflate the Intact Tyre**
       - **Action:** `inflate`
       - *Preconditions:* Agent has a pump, tyre is intact and not inflated.
       - *Effect:* Intact tyre is inflated.

   14. **Do-Up (Fasten) the Nuts on the Hub**
       - **Action:** `do-up`
       - *Preconditions:* Agent has a wrench, hub is unfastened, hub is jacked up, agent holds the nut.
       - *Effect:* Nut is now loose on the hub, hub is fastened, agent no longer holds the nut.

   15. **Tighten the Nuts on the Hub**
       - **Action:** `tighten`
       - *Preconditions:* Agent has a wrench, nuts on hub are loose, hub is jacked up.
       - *Effect:* Nuts on hub are tight.

   16. **Jack Down the Hub Back to the Ground**
       - **Action:** `jack-down`
       - *Preconditions:* Hub is jacked up.
       - *Effect:* Hub is back on the ground, agent holds the jack.

5. **Store Tools Back in the Boot After Processing All Hubs**
   - **Action:** `open`
   - *Precondition:* Boot is closed.
   - *Effect:* Boot is open.

   - **Action:** `put-away wrench`
   - **Action:** `put-away jack`
   - **Action:** `put-away pump`
   - *Precondition for each `put-away`*: Agent is holding the respective tool, boot is open.
   - *Effect for each `put-away`*: Tool is inside the boot, agent no longer holds it.

   - **Action:** `close`
   - *Precondition:* Boot is open.
   - *Effect:* Boot is closed.

### **Summary of the Plan:**

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Open the boot and retrieve all necessary tools (wrench, jack, pump) and the intact tyres.
   - Close the boot to secure the items.

2. **Processing Hubs:**
   - For each of the 8 hubs:
     - Loosen nuts, jack up the hub, undo the nuts, and remove the flat tyre.
     - Store the flat tyre back in the boot.
     - Install the intact tyre, inflate it, fasten and tighten the nuts, and lower the hub back to the ground.

3. **Finalizing:**
   - After all hubs are processed, store all tools back in the boot and ensure it is closed.

### **Notes for Optimal Execution:**

- **Tool Management:** Fetch all tools at once at the beginning to avoid repeated fetching and storing.
- **Batch Processing:** Handle each hub sequentially to maintain organization and minimize boot access actions.
- **Inflation:** Inflate each intact tyre immediately after installation to ensure readiness.
- **Security:** Ensure that nuts are tightened properly on each hub before moving to the next to maintain safety.

By following this structured plan, you'll efficiently replace all flat tyres with intact, inflated ones, secure all tools and spare parts back in the boot, and ensure the boot is properly closed, achieving all stated goals optimally.
