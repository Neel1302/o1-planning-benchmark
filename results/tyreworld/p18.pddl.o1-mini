Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to replace the 18 flat tyres with intact tyres on the hubs, ensuring all conditions of the goal are met. The plan is structured in a sequence of actions, optimized to minimize repetitive operations where possible.

### **Initial Steps: Prepare Tools and Intact Tyres**

1. **`open`** - Open the boot (precondition: boot is unlocked and closed).
2. **`fetch wrench`** - Retrieve the wrench from the boot.
3. **`fetch jack`** - Retrieve the jack from the boot.
4. **`fetch pump`** - Retrieve the pump from the boot.
5. **`fetch intact tyre 1`**
6. **`fetch intact tyre 2`**
7. **`...`** *(Repeat fetch actions for all 18 intact tyres)*
22. **`fetch intact tyre 18`**
23. **`close`** - Close the boot after fetching all necessary tools and tyres.

### **Per-Hub Operations (Repeat for Each of the 18 Hubs)**

For each hub (from Hub 1 to Hub 18), perform the following sequence of actions:

#### **a. Loosen and Remove the Flat Tyre**

1. **`loosen`** - Loosen the tight nut on the current hub.
   - *Preconditions:* Agent has a wrench, nut is tight, hub is on the ground.
   - *Effects:* Nut becomes loose.

2. **`jack-up`** - Lift the hub off the ground using the jack.
   - *Preconditions:* Agent has a jack, hub is on the ground.
   - *Effects:* Hub is elevated; jack is no longer held by the agent.

3. **`undo`** - Completely undo the nut fastening.
   - *Preconditions:* Hub is jacked up, hub is fastened, agent has a wrench, nut is loose.
   - *Effects:* Agent now holds the nut; hub is unfastened and not loose.

4. **`remove-wheel`** - Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
   - *Preconditions:* Hub is jacked up, flat tyre is on the hub, hub is unfastened.
   - *Effects:* Agent holds the removed flat tyre; hub is free.

#### **b. Replace with Intact Tyre**

5. **`open`** - Open the boot to store the flat tyre.
6. **`put-away`** - Place the flat tyre into the boot.
   - *Preconditions:* Agent holds the flat tyre; boot is open.
   - *Effects:* Flat tyre is stored in the boot; agent no longer holds it.

7. **`close`** - Close the boot after storing the flat tyre.
8. **`put-on-wheel`** - Attach the intact tyre to the hub.
   - *Preconditions:* Agent holds an intact tyre, hub is free, hub is unfastened, hub is not on the ground.
   - *Effects:* Intact tyre is on the hub; hub is no longer free; agent no longer holds the tyre.

9. **`do-up`** - Begin fastening the nut on the hub.
   - *Preconditions:* Agent has a wrench, hub is unfastened, hub is jacked up, agent holds the nut.
   - *Effects:* Nut is loose on the hub; hub is fastened.

10. **`tighten`** - Tighten the nut to secure the intact tyre firmly.
    - *Preconditions:* Agent has a wrench, nut is loose, hub is on the ground.
    - *Effects:* Nut becomes tight.

11. **`inflate`** - Inflate the newly attached intact tyre using the pump.
    - *Preconditions:* Agent has a pump, intact tyre is not inflated, intact tyre is intact.
    - *Effects:* Intact tyre is inflated.

12. **`jack-down`** - Lower the hub back to the ground from the elevated position.
    - *Preconditions:* Hub is jacked up.
    - *Effects:* Hub is back on the ground; agent has the jack.

### **Final Steps: Store Tools and Ensure Boot is Properly Secured**

After all 18 hubs have been processed, perform the following actions to ensure all tools and remaining items are stored correctly:

24. **`open`** - Open the boot.
25. **`put-away wrench`** - Store the wrench back into the boot.
26. **`put-away jack`** - Store the jack back into the boot.
27. **`put-away pump`** - Store the pump back into the boot.
   - *(Assuming all 18 intact tyres are already on the hubs and inflated, no need to store them.)*
28. **`close`** - Close the boot securely.

### **Summary of Action Sequence**

1. open
2. fetch wrench
3. fetch jack
4. fetch pump
5. fetch intact tyre 1
6. fetch intact tyre 2
7. ...
22. fetch intact tyre 18
23. close
24-28. *For each of the 18 hubs:*
   - loosen
   - jack-up
   - undo
   - remove-wheel
   - open
   - put-away
   - close
   - put-on-wheel
   - do-up
   - tighten
   - inflate
   - jack-down
29. open
30. put-away wrench
31. put-away jack
32. put-away pump
33. close

### **Notes for Optimal Execution**

- **Batch Operations:** To enhance efficiency, ensure that all necessary tools and intact tyres are fetched upfront before starting the hub replacements. This avoids repeated opening and closing of the boot for each hub.

- **Parallel Processing:** If possible, holding multiple intact tyres in hand or using appropriate tool handling techniques can reduce the number of fetch and put-away actions.

- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent sequence for each hub to ensure reliability and safety during the tyre replacement process.

By following this structured and optimized sequence of actions, you will successfully replace all flat tyres with intact, inflated tyres while ensuring that all tools and flat tyres are neatly stored in the boot, which remains closed and secure at the end of the operation.
