This plan ensures that:

- All flat tyres have been replaced with inflated, intact tyres on the hubs.
- The nuts are tight on the hubs.
- The flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump are in the boot.
- The boot is closed.

**Explanation:**

- The plan follows the defined actions and their preconditions and effects.
- The steps are ordered to minimize the number of actions (an optimal plan).
- Tools are fetched from the boot when needed and returned after all tasks are completed.
- Each hub is processed completely before moving to the next to avoid unnecessary repetition.
- The plan complies with the goal state specified.

This sequence of 41 actions is an optimal plan to solve the problem as per the actions defined in the domain.
