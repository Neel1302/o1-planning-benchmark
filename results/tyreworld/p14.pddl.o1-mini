Certainly! Below is an optimal sequence of actions to replace the flat tyres with intact tyres on the hubs, ensuring all goals are met. This plan iterates through each of the 14 hubs, performing the necessary actions efficiently.

### **Initial Setup:**
1. **Open** the boot.
2. **Fetch** the **wrench** from the boot.
3. **Fetch** the **jack** from the boot.
4. **Fetch** the **pump** from the boot.
5. **Close** the boot.

### **For Each of the 14 Hubs:**

**Repeat the following steps for Hub 1 through Hub 14:**

6. **Loosen** the nut on the hub.
7. **Jack-up** the hub to lift it off the ground.
8. **Remove-wheel** the flat tyre from the hub.
9. **Open** the boot.
10. **Put-away** the flat tyre into the boot.
11. **Fetch** an **intact tyre** from the boot.
12. **Close** the boot.
13. **Put-on-wheel** the intact tyre onto the hub.
14. **Inflate** the intact tyre using the pump.
15. **Tighten** the nut on the hub to secure the tyre.
16. **Jack-down** the hub to lower it back to the ground.

### **Finalizing:**
17. **Open** the boot.
18. **Put-away** the **wrench**, **jack**, and **pump** back into the boot.
19. **Ensure** all flat tyres are stored in the boot.
20. **Close** the boot.

### **Summary of Actions:**

1. **open**
2. **fetch** (wrench)
3. **fetch** (jack)
4. **fetch** (pump)
5. **close**
6. For each hub (1 to 14):
   - **loosen**
   - **jack-up**
   - **remove-wheel**
   - **open**
   - **put-away** (flat tyre)
   - **fetch** (intact tyre)
   - **close**
   - **put-on-wheel**
   - **inflate**
   - **tighten**
   - **jack-down**
7. **open**
8. **put-away** (wrench)
9. **put-away** (jack)
10. **put-away** (pump)
11. **close**

### **Notes:**
- **Inflation:** Each intact tyre is inflated immediately after being put on the hub to ensure it meets the goal of being inflated.
- **Tool Management:** Tools are fetched at the beginning and put back into the boot after all hubs have been serviced, minimizing repeated fetching and putting away.
- **Boot Handling:** The boot is opened only when necessary (e.g., to put away flat tyres or fetch intact tyres) and remains closed otherwise to maintain security and organization.

This plan ensures that all flat tyres are replaced efficiently, intact tyres are properly inflated, nuts are tightened, and all tools and flat tyres are securely stored back in the boot, which is closed at the end.
