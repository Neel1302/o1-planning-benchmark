Yes, here is a sequence of actions that will result in the goal state:

1. "open" the boot
2. "fetch" the wrench from the boot
3. "fetch" the jack from the boot
4. "fetch" the pump from the boot
5. For each of the 15 hubs, do steps 6 to 20.
6. "loosen" the nut on the hub with the wrench
7. "jack-up" the hub
8. "undo" the nut on the hub
9. "remove-wheel" from the hub
10. "put-away" the flat tyre into the boot
11. "fetch" an intact tyre from the boot
12. "inflate" the uninflected tyre using the pump
13. "put-on-wheel" onto the hub with the inflated tyre
14. "do-up" the nut on the hub
15. "jack-down" the hub
16. "tighten" the nut on the hub with the wrench
17. "put-away" the wrench into the boot
18. "put-away" the pump into the boot
19. "put-away" the jack into the boot
20. "close" the boot

Note that each cycle of steps 6 to 20 corresponds to replacing a flat tyre on a single hub, inflating the new tyre, and putting the flat tyre and tools back into the boot. You do this for each of the 15 hubs. The plan includes 15 cycles of steps 6 to 20, which is 225 steps.

The end result will be a situation where all the flat tyres have been replaced with inflated ones, all the tyres are secure on the hubs, and all the tools and flat tyres are back in the closed boot, as required.
