Sure! Here's an optimal plan presented as a sequence of actions to solve the problem:

1. **Open Boot:**
   - **Action:** `open` the boot.
   - **Justification:** The boot is initially closed and unlocked. Opening it allows access to the tools and tyres.

2. **Fetch Tools and Tyres:**
   - **Action:** For each tool (wrench, jack, pump), perform `fetch` action.
     - **Fetch Wrench**
     - **Fetch Jack**
     - **Fetch Pump**
   - **Action:** For each of the 19 intact tyres, perform `fetch` action.
     - **Fetch Intact Tyre 1**
     - **Fetch Intact Tyre 2**
     - ...
     - **Fetch Intact Tyre 19**
   - **Justification:** Tools and intact tyres are needed for the replacement process.

3. **Inflate Intact Tyres:**
   - **Action:** For each of the 19 intact tyres, perform `inflate` action.
     - **Inflate Intact Tyre 1**
     - **Inflate Intact Tyre 2**
     - ...
     - **Inflate Intact Tyre 19**
   - **Justification:** The tyres need to be inflated before they can be installed.

4. **Replace Flat Tyres with Intact Tyres:**
   - **For each of the 19 hubs (repeat the following steps):**

     a. **Loosen Nut:**
        - **Action:** `loosen` the nut on the hub.
        - **Preconditions:** Agent has wrench, nut is tight, hub is on ground.
        - **Justification:** Loosening the nut prepares it for removal.

     b. **Jack Up Hub:**
        - **Action:** `jack-up` the hub.
        - **Preconditions:** Agent has jack, hub is on ground.
        - **Justification:** Lifting the hub allows for tyre removal.

     c. **Undo Nut:**
        - **Action:** `undo` the nut on the hub.
        - **Preconditions:** Agent has wrench, nut is loose, hub is not on ground, hub is fastened.
        - **Justification:** Removing the nut releases the wheel.

     d. **Remove Flat Tyre:**
        - **Action:** `remove-wheel` from the hub.
        - **Preconditions:** Hub is not on ground, wheel is on hub, hub is unfastened.
        - **Justification:** Removes the flat tyre from the hub. Agent now has the flat tyre.

     e. **Install Inflated Intact Tyre:**
        - **Action:** `put-on-wheel` (use the corresponding inflated intact tyre).
        - **Preconditions:** Agent has the inflated intact tyre, hub is free, hub is unfastened, hub is not on ground.
        - **Justification:** Places the new tyre onto the hub.

     f. **Do Up Nut:**
        - **Action:** `do-up` the nut on the hub.
        - **Preconditions:** Agent has wrench, agent has nut, hub is unfastened, hub is not on ground.
        - **Justification:** Attaches the wheel to the hub loosely.

     g. **Jack Down Hub:**
        - **Action:** `jack-down` the hub.
        - **Preconditions:** Hub is not on ground.
        - **Justification:** Lowers the vehicle back to the ground.

     h. **Tighten Nut:**
        - **Action:** `tighten` the nut on the hub.
        - **Preconditions:** Agent has wrench, nut on hub is loose, hub is on ground.
        - **Justification:** Secures the wheel firmly to the hub.

5. **Put Away Tools and Flat Tyres:**
   - **Action:** For each flat tyre (now held by the agent), perform `put-away` action.
     - **Put Away Flat Tyre 1**
     - **Put Away Flat Tyre 2**
     - ...
     - **Put Away Flat Tyre 19**
   - **Action:** Perform `put-away` action for each tool.
     - **Put Away Wrench**
     - **Put Away Jack**
     - **Put Away Pump**
   - **Justification:** Returns all items to the boot.

6. **Close Boot:**
   - **Action:** `close` the boot.
   - **Justification:** Ensures the boot is closed as per the goal state.

**Explanation:**

- **Efficiency:** By fetching all tools and tyres at the beginning and inflating all tyres before starting the replacement process, we minimize repetitive actions.
- **Compliance:** Each action meets the preconditions and effects as defined in the domain.
- **Goal Achievement:** The plan results in all flat tyres being replaced with inflated intact tyres on the hubs. All tools and flat tyres are stored in the boot, which is then closed.

**Sequence Summary:**

1. Open boot.
2. Fetch wrench, jack, pump, and all intact tyres.
3. Inflate all intact tyres.
4. For each of the 19 hubs:
   - Loosen nut.
   - Jack up hub.
   - Undo nut.
   - Remove flat tyre (agent now has flat tyre).
   - Put on inflated intact tyre.
   - Do up nut.
   - Jack down hub.
   - Tighten nut.
5. Put away all flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump into the boot.
6. Close boot.

This plan efficiently replaces all flat tyres with inflated intact tyres, secures the nuts, and ensures that all tools and removed tyres are properly stored with the boot closed, satisfying all goals.
