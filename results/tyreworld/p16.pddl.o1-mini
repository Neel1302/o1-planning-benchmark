Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to replace the flat tyres with intact ones on all 16 hubs, ensuring that all conditions and goals are met. The plan is structured to minimize the number of times the boot is opened and closed, thereby optimizing efficiency.

---

### **Initial Setup:**
1. **Open** the boot.
2. **Fetch** the **wrench**.
3. **Fetch** the **jack**.
4. **Fetch** the **pump**.
5. **Fetch** all **intact tyres** (assuming the agent can carry multiple tyres; if not, fetch them one at a time as needed).
6. **Close** the boot.

### **For Each of the 16 Hubs, Perform the Following Sequence:**

#### **a. Loosening and Removal:**
7. **Loosen** the **nuts** on the current **hub**.
8. **Jack-up** the **hub** to lift it off the ground.
9. **Remove-wheel** to detach the **flat tyre** from the **hub**.

#### **b. Handling the Flat Tyre:**
10. **Open** the boot.
11. **Put-away** the **flat tyre** into the boot.
12. **Close** the boot.

#### **c. Installing the Intact Tyre:**
13. **Fetch** an **intact tyre** from the boot.
14. **Put-on-wheel** to attach the **intact tyre** onto the **hub**.

#### **d. Inflating and Securing:**
15. **Inflate** the newly installed **intact tyre** using the **pump**.
16. **Tighten** the **nuts** on the **hub** to secure the **intact tyre**.
17. **Jack-down** the **hub** to lower it back to the ground.

---

### **Final Steps:**
18. **Ensure** that all **flat tyres**, **wrench**, **jack**, and **pump** are in the boot.
19. **Close** the boot to complete the process.

---

### **Summary of Actions:**

1. **Open**
2. **Fetch wrench**
3. **Fetch jack**
4. **Fetch pump**
5. **Fetch intact tyres**
6. **Close**
7. **Loosen**
8. **Jack-up**
9. **Remove-wheel**
10. **Open**
11. **Put-away flat tyre**
12. **Close**
13. **Fetch intact tyre**
14. **Put-on-wheel**
15. **Inflate**
16. **Tighten**
17. **Jack-down**
18. **Ensure all tools and flat tyres are in the boot**
19. **Close**

---

**Note:** Steps 7 to 17 are repeated sequentially for each of the 16 hubs. This ensures that all flat tyres are replaced with intact ones, inflated appropriately, and secured with tight nuts. By fetching all necessary tools and intact tyres at the beginning, the number of times the boot needs to be opened and closed is minimized, enhancing the efficiency of the plan.
