Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

**Initial Actions:**

1. **Open the boot:**
   - `open(boot)`

2. **Fetch the necessary tools:**
   - `fetch(wrench)`
   - `fetch(jack)`
   - `fetch(pump)`

**For each of the 13 hubs (from 1 to 13), perform the following actions:**

**(We will denote each hub, nut, flat tyre, and intact tyre with an index `i` where `i` ranges from 1 to 13.)**

3. **Fetch the intact tyre for the hub:**
   - `fetch(intact_tyre_i)`

       - `hub_i` is not fastened.

8. **Remove the flat tyre from the hub:**
   - `remove-wheel(flat_tyre_i, hub_i)`
     - *Preconditions:*
       - `hub_i` is unfastened.
       - `flat_tyre_i` is on `hub_i`.
       - `hub_i` is not on the ground.
     - *Effect:*
       - Agent has `flat_tyre_i`.
       - `flat_tyre_i` is no longer on `hub_i`.

9. **Put the inflated, intact tyre on the hub:**
   - `put-on-wheel(intact_tyre_i, hub_i)`
     - *Preconditions:*
       - Agent has `intact_tyre_i`.
       - `hub_i` is free.
       - `hub_i` is unfastened.
       - `hub_i` is not on the ground.
     - *Effect:*
       - `intact_tyre_i` is on `hub_i`.
       - `hub_i` is no longer free.
       - Agent no longer has `intact_tyre_i`.

10. **Fasten the nut on the hub:**
    - `do-up(nut_i, hub_i)`
      - *Preconditions:*
        - Agent has `wrench`.
        - `hub_i` is unfastened.
        - `hub_i` is not on the ground.
        - Agent has `nut_i`.
      - *Effect:*
        - `nut_i` is now loose on `hub_i`.
        - `hub_i` is fastened.
        - Agent no longer has `nut_i`.

11. **Jack down the hub:**
    - `jack-down(hub_i)`
      - *Preconditions:*
        - `hub_i` is not on the ground.
      - *Effect:*
        - `hub_i` is on the ground.
        - Agent has the `jack`.

12. **Tighten the nut on the hub:**
    - `tighten(nut_i, hub_i)`
      - *Preconditions:*
        - Agent has `wrench`.
        - `nut_i` on `hub_i` is loose.
        - `hub_i` is on the ground.
      - *Effect:*
        - `nut_i` on `hub_i` is now tight.
        - `nut_i` is not loose.

13. **Put away the flat tyre into the boot:**
    - `put-away(flat_tyre_i)`
      - *Preconditions:*
        - Agent has `flat_tyre_i`.
        - `boot` is open.
      - *Effect:*
        - `flat_tyre_i` is inside the `boot`.
        - Agent no longer has `flat_tyre_i`.

**After all hubs have been processed, put away the tools:**

14. **Put away the pump:**
    - `put-away(pump)`

15. **Put away the jack:**
    - `put-away(jack)`

16. **Put away the wrench:**
    - `put-away(wrench)`

17. **Close the boot:**
    - `close(boot)`
      - *Preconditions:*
        - `boot` is open.
      - *Effect:*
        - `boot` is closed.
        - `boot` is not open.

**Summary of Actions:**

- **Initial Actions:** 4 actions (steps 1-4).
- **Per Hub Actions:** 11 actions per hub Ã— 13 hubs = 143 actions (steps 5-17 repeated for each hub).
- **Final Actions:** 4 actions (steps 14-17).

**Total Actions:** 4 (initial) + 143 (per hub) + 4 (final) = **151 actions**.

This plan ensures that:

- All flat tyres are replaced with inflated, intact tyres on the hubs.
- The nuts are tight on the hubs.
- All flat tyres, the wrench, the jack, and the pump are in the boot.
- The boot is closed at the end.

This is the optimal plan given the constraints and actions defined in the domain.
