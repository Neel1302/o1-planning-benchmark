Sure, here is the sequence of actions that you can undertake:

1. "Open" the boot.
2. "Fetch" the jack from the boot.
3. "Fetch" the wrench from the boot.
4. "Fetch" the pump from the boot.
5. Repeat the following steps 16 times (once for each hub):
    5.1 "Loosen" the hub's nut using the wrench.
    5.2 "Jack-up" the hub using the jack.
    5.3 "Undo" the nut on the hub.
    5.4 "Remove-wheel" the flat tyre from the hub.
    5.5 "Fetch" an intact tyre from the boot.
    5.6 "Inflate" the tyre using the pump.
    5.7 "Put-on-wheel" the inflated tyre onto the hub.
    5.8 "Do-up" the nut on the hub.
    5.9 "Jack-down" the hub using the jack.
    5.10 "Tighten" the hub's nut using the wrench.
    5.11 "Fetch" the flat tyre
    5.12 "Put-away" the flat tyre in the boot.
6. "Put-away" the jack in the boot.
7. "Put-away" the wrench in the boot.
