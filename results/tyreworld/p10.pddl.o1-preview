Sure, here's an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. **Open the boot**:  
   *Action*: `open(boot)`  
   *Precondition*: Boot is unlocked and closed.  
   *Effect*: Boot is open.

2. **Fetch the wrench from the boot**:  
   *Action*: `fetch(wrench, boot)`  
   *Precondition*: Wrench is in the boot and boot is open.  
   *Effect*: Agent has the wrench.

3. **Fetch the jack from the boot**:  
   *Action*: `fetch(jack, boot)`  
   *Precondition*: Jack is in the boot and boot is open.  
   *Effect*: Agent has the jack.

4. **Fetch the pump from the boot**:  
   *Action*: `fetch(pump, boot)`  
   *Precondition*: Pump is in the boot and boot is open.  
   *Effect*: Agent has the pump.

5. **Fetch all intact tyres from the boot**:  
   For each intact tyre `tyre_i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to 10):  
   *Action*: `fetch(tyre_i_intact, boot)`  
   *Precondition*: `tyre_i_intact` is in the boot and boot is open.  
   *Effect*: Agent has `tyre_i_intact`.

Now, for each hub `hub_i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to 10), perform the following steps:

6. **Loosen the nut on hub_i**:  
   *Action*: `loosen(nut_i, hub_i)`  
   *Precondition*: Agent has the wrench, nut on `hub_i` is tight, and `hub_i` is on the ground.  
   *Effect*: Nut on `hub_i` is loose.

7. **Jack up hub_i**:  
   *Action*: `jack-up(hub_i)`  
   *Precondition*: Agent has the jack and `hub_i` is on the ground.  
   *Effect*: `hub_i` is off the ground, agent no longer has the jack.

8. **Undo the fastening of the nut on hub_i**:  
   *Action*: `undo(nut_i, hub_i)`  
   *Precondition*: `hub_i` is off the ground, `hub_i` is fastened, agent has the wrench, and nut on `hub_i` is loose.  
   *Effect*: Agent has `nut_i`, `hub_i` is unfastened.

9. **Remove the flat tyre from hub_i**:  
   *Action*: `remove-wheel(wheel_flat_i, hub_i)`  
   *Precondition*: `hub_i` is off the ground, `wheel_flat_i` is on `hub_i`, and `hub_i` is unfastened.  
   *Effect*: Agent has `wheel_flat_i`, `hub_i` is free.

10. **Put the intact tyre onto hub_i**:  
    *Action*: `put-on-wheel(wheel_intact_i, hub_i)`  
    *Precondition*: Agent has `wheel_intact_i`, `hub_i` is free, `hub_i` is unfastened, and `hub_i` is off the ground.  
    *Effect*: `wheel_intact_i` is on `hub_i`, agent no longer has `wheel_intact_i`.

11. **Fasten the nut on hub_i**:  
    *Action*: `do-up(nut_i, hub_i)`  
    *Precondition*: Agent has the wrench, agent has `nut_i`, `hub_i` is unfastened, and `hub_i` is off the ground.  
    *Effect*: Nut on `hub_i` is loose, `hub_i` is fastened, agent no longer has `nut_i`.

12. **Jack down hub_i**:  
    *Action*: `jack-down(hub_i)`  
    *Precondition*: `hub_i` is off the ground.  
    *Effect*: `hub_i` is on the ground, agent has the jack.

13. **Tighten the nut on hub_i**:  
    *Action*: `tighten(nut_i, hub_i)`  
    *Precondition*: Agent has the wrench, nut on `hub_i` is loose, and `hub_i` is on the ground.  
    *Effect*: Nut on `hub_i` is tight.

14. **Inflate the intact tyre on hub_i**:  
    *Action*: `inflate(wheel_intact_i)`  
    *Precondition*: Agent has the pump, `wheel_intact_i` is not inflated, and `wheel_intact_i` is intact.  
    *Effect*: `wheel_intact_i` is inflated.

15. **Put the flat tyre into the boot**:  
    *Action*: `put-away(wheel_flat_i, boot)`  
    *Precondition*: Agent has `wheel_flat_i` and boot is open.  
    *Effect*: `wheel_flat_i` is inside the boot.

Repeat steps 6 to 15 for all hubs from `hub_1` to `hub_10`.

Finally, after replacing all tyres:

16. **Put the wrench into the boot**:  
    *Action*: `put-away(wrench, boot)`  
    *Precondition*: Agent has the wrench and boot is open.  
    *Effect*: Wrench is inside the boot.

17. **Put the jack into the boot**:  
    *Action*: `put-away(jack, boot)`  
    *Precondition*: Agent has the jack and boot is open.  
    *Effect*: Jack is inside the boot.

18. **Put the pump into the boot**:  
    *Action*: `put-away(pump, boot)`  
    *Precondition*: Agent has the pump and boot is open.  
    *Effect*: Pump is inside the boot.

19. **Close the boot**:  
    *Action*: `close(boot)`  
    *Precondition*: Boot is open.  
    *Effect*: Boot is closed.

This plan ensures that all flat tyres are replaced with intact, inflated tyres, the nuts are tight on the hubs, the flat tyres and tools are back in the boot, and the boot is closed at the end.
