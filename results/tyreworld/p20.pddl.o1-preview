To solve the problem efficiently, we need to perform a series of actions that replace each flat tire with an intact, inflated tire on each hub, ensuring that all the specified conditions are met. Below is an optimal plan that minimizes the number of actions while adhering to the domain's constraints:

**Initial Actions (4 actions):**
1. **Open the boot.** (Open action)
2. **Fetch the wrench from the boot.** (Fetch action)
3. **Fetch the jack from the boot.** (Fetch action)
4. **Fetch the pump from the boot.** (Fetch action)

**For each of the 20 hubs, perform the following actions (11 actions per hub, total 220 actions):**

*Repeat the steps below for each hub from 1 to 20.*

5. **Fetch an intact tire from the boot.** (Fetch action)
6. **Inflate the intact tire.** (Inflate action)
7. **Loosen the nut on the hub.** (Loosen action)
   - *Preconditions:* Agent has wrench, nut is tight, hub is on ground.
8. **Jack up the hub.** (Jack-up action)
   - *Preconditions:* Agent has jack, hub is on ground.
   - *Effects:* Hub is not on ground, agent no longer has the jack.
9. **Undo the nut on the hub.** (Undo action)
   - *Preconditions:* Hub is not on ground, hub is fastened, agent has wrench, nut is loose.
   - *Effects:* Agent has nut, hub is unfastened.
10. **Remove the flat tire from the hub.** (Remove-wheel action)
    - *Preconditions:* Hub is not on ground, wheel is on hub, hub is unfastened.
    - *Effects:* Agent has flat tire, wheel is no longer on hub.
11. **Put the inflated intact tire onto the hub.** (Put-on-wheel action)
    - *Preconditions:* Agent has wheel, hub is free, hub is unfastened, hub is not on ground.
    - *Effects:* Wheel is on hub, agent no longer has wheel.
12. **Do up the nut on the hub.** (Do-up action)
    - *Preconditions:* Agent has wrench, hub is unfastened, agent has nut, hub is not on ground.
    - *Effects:* Nut is loose on hub, hub is fastened, agent no longer has nut.
13. **Jack down the hub.** (Jack-down action)
    - *Preconditions:* Hub is not on ground.
    - *Effects:* Hub is on ground, agent has jack.
14. **Tighten the nut on the hub.** (Tighten action)
    - *Preconditions:* Agent has wrench, nut on hub is loose, hub is on ground.
    - *Effects:* Nut on hub is tight.
15. **Put away the flat tire into the boot.** (Put-away action)
    - *Preconditions:* Agent has flat tire, boot is open.
    - *Effects:* Flat tire is in the boot, agent no longer has flat tire.

**Final Actions (4 actions):**
16. **Put away the wrench into the boot.** (Put-away action)
17. **Put away the jack into the boot.** (Put-away action)
18. **Put away the pump into the boot.** (Put-away action)
19. **Close the boot.** (Close action)

**Total Actions:**
- Initial actions: 4
- Actions per hub: 11 Ã— 20 hubs = 220
- Final actions: 4
- **Total:** 4 + 220 + 4 = **228 actions**

This plan ensures that:
- All flat tires are replaced with inflated, intact tires on the hubs.
- The intact tires are inflated before being mounted.
- The nuts are tight on the hubs after replacement.
- All flat tires, along with the wrench, jack, and pump, are placed back into the boot.
- The boot is closed at the end.

By fetching tools and performing actions systematically per hub, and by putting away flat tires immediately after replacing them, we minimize unnecessary movements and actions, resulting in an optimal and efficient plan.
