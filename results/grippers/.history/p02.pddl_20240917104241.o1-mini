Certainly! Let's devise an optimal plan to transport the balls to their respective destinations using the two robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper.

Problem Overview
Robots:

robot1 is initially in room2.
robot2 is initially in room3.
Balls:

ball1 is in room3 → Destination: room2
ball2 is in room1 → Destination: room2
ball3 is in room1 → Destination: room3
ball4 is in room3 → Destination: room3 (Already at the destination)
Grippers:

All grippers (left and right) for both robots are initially free.
Goal State
Balls:
ball1 in room2
ball2 in room2
ball3 in room3
ball4 remains in room3
Optimal Plan
To achieve the goal efficiently, we'll assign tasks to both robots to minimize the total number of actions. Here's a step-by-step sequence:

robot2 Picks Up ball1 with Left Gripper

Action: robot2 performs left-pick on ball1.
Preconditions:
ball1 is in room3.
robot2 is in room3.
robot2's left gripper is free.
Effects:
robot2 is now carrying ball1 with the left gripper.
ball1 is no longer in room3.
robot2's left gripper is occupied.
robot2 Moves from room3 to room2

Action: robot2 performs move from room3 to room2.
Preconditions:
robot2 is in room3.
Effects:
robot2 is now in room2.
robot2 is no longer in room3.
robot2 Drops ball1 in room2 with Left Gripper

Action: robot2 performs left-drop on ball1.
Preconditions:
robot2 is carrying ball1 with the left gripper.
robot2 is in room2.
Effects:
ball1 is now in room2.
robot2 is no longer carrying ball1.
robot2's left gripper is free.
robot1 Moves from room2 to room1

Action: robot1 performs move from room2 to room1.
Preconditions:
robot1 is in room2.
Effects:
robot1 is now in room1.
robot1 is no longer in room2.
robot1 Picks Up ball2 with Left Gripper

Action: robot1 performs left-pick on ball2.
Preconditions:
ball2 is in room1.
robot1 is in room1.
robot1's left gripper is free.
Effects:
robot1 is now carrying ball2 with the left gripper.
ball2 is no longer in room1.
robot1's left gripper is occupied.
robot1 Picks Up ball3 with Right Gripper

Action: robot1 performs right-pick on ball3.
Preconditions:
ball3 is in room1.
robot1 is in room1.
robot1's right gripper is free.
Effects:
robot1 is now carrying ball3 with the right gripper.
ball3 is no longer in room1.
robot1's right gripper is occupied.
robot1 Moves from room1 to room2

Action: robot1 performs move from room1 to room2.
Preconditions:
robot1 is in room1.
Effects:
robot1 is now in room2.
robot1 is no longer in room1.
robot1 Drops ball2 in room2 with Left Gripper

Action: robot1 performs left-drop on ball2.
Preconditions:
robot1 is carrying ball2 with the left gripper.
robot1 is in room2.
Effects:
ball2 is now in room2.
robot1 is no longer carrying ball2.
robot1's left gripper is free.
robot1 Moves from room2 to room3

Action: robot1 performs move from room2 to room3.
Preconditions:
robot1 is in room2.
Effects:
robot1 is now in room3.
robot1 is no longer in room2.
robot1 Drops ball3 in room3 with Right Gripper

Action: robot1 performs right-drop on ball3.
Preconditions:
robot1 is carrying ball3 with the right gripper.
robot1 is in room3.
Effects:
ball3 is now in room3.
robot1 is no longer carrying ball3.
robot1's right gripper is free.
Summary of Actions
Step	Robot	Gripper	Action	Object	From Room	To Room	Description
1	robot2	Left	Pick	ball1	room3	-	Pick up ball1 in room3.
2	robot2	-	Move	-	room3	room2	Move from room3 to room2.
3	robot2	Left	Drop	ball1	-	room2	Drop ball1 in room2.
4	robot1	-	Move	-	room2	room1	Move from room2 to room1.
5	robot1	Left	Pick	ball2	room1	-	Pick up ball2 in room1.
6	robot1	Right	Pick	ball3	room1	-	Pick up ball3 in room1.
7	robot1	-	Move	-	room1	room2	Move from room1 to room2.
8	robot1	Left	Drop	ball2	-	room2	Drop ball2 in room2.
9	robot1	-	Move	-	room2	room3	Move from room2 to room3.
10	robot1	Right	Drop	ball3	-	room3	Drop ball3 in room3.
Final State Validation
robot1: Located in room3, both grippers are free.
robot2: Located in room2, both grippers are free.
Balls:
ball1 is in room2 ✅
ball2 is in room2 ✅
ball3 is in room3 ✅
ball4 remains in room3 ✅
All balls have been transported to their respective destinations as per the goal state.

Notes:
Efficiency Considerations:

robot2 handles ball1 independently, allowing robot1 to focus on moving both ball2 and ball3.
By utilizing both grippers of robot1, we minimize the number of movements required.
Parallel Actions:

While the above plan lists actions sequentially for clarity, in an actual implementation, some actions (like steps 1-3 and 4-10) could potentially be performed in parallel to reduce total execution time.
If you have any additional constraints or require further optimizations, feel free to let me know!
