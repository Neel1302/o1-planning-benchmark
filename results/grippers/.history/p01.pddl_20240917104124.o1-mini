Based on the problem description provided, let's analyze the initial and goal states to determine the optimal plan.

Initial State:
Robots:
robot1 is in room1.
robot2 is in room1.
Balls:
ball1 is in room1.
ball2 is in room1.
Grippers:
All grippers (left and right) for both robots are free.
Goal State:
Balls:
ball1 should be in room1.
ball2 should be in room1.
Analysis:
Current Positions vs. Goal:
Both ball1 and ball2 are already in room1, which matches the goal state.
Robot and Gripper Status:
Both robots are in room1, and all grippers are free, meaning there are no conflicts or additional actions required.
Conclusion:
Since the initial state already satisfies the goal conditions, no actions are necessary. The system is already in the desired state.

Optimal Plan:
No actions needed. The current state meets all the goal requirements.
If there was an intention to move the balls to a different room or if there are additional constraints not mentioned, please provide those details so I can assist you further.
