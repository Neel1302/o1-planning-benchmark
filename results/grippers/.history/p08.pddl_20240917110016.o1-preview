Ball5: Remains in Room1 (already in the desired location).
Robot Positions:

Robot1: In Room1 with both grippers free.
Robot2: In Room2 with both grippers free.
Robot3: In Room1 with both grippers free.
Optimality Explanation:
Total Actions: 11 actions (5 by Robot1, 3 by Robot2, and 3 by Robot3).
Efficiency:
Robot1 maximizes its capacity by carrying two balls in one trip.
Robot3 transports the remaining ball from Room2 to Room1.
Robot2 efficiently moves Ball3 from Room1 to Room2.
Resource Utilization:
All three robots are utilized effectively to minimize the total number of actions.
