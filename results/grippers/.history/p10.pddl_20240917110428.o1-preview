Robot3 drops Ball2 in Room1 from its left gripper:

Action: drop(robot3, ball2, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot3 is holding Ball2 with its left gripper.
Robot3 is in Room1.
Effects:
Ball2 is now in Room1.
Robot3 is no longer holding Ball2.
Left gripper of Robot3 is now free.
Robot3 drops Ball3 in Room1 from its right gripper:

Action: drop(robot3, ball3, right_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot3 is holding Ball3 with its right gripper.
Robot3 is in Room1.
Effects:
Ball3 is now in Room1.
Robot3 is no longer holding Ball3.
Right gripper of Robot3 is now free.
Robot1's Actions (Total: 4 actions):
Robot1 moves from Room1 to Room2:

Action: move(robot1, room1, room2)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is in Room1.
Effects:
Robot1 is now in Room2.
Robot1 is no longer in Room1.
Robot1 picks up Ball4 with its left gripper in Room2:

Action: pick(robot1, ball4, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball4 is in Room2.
Robot1 is in Room2.
Left gripper of Robot1 is free.
Effects:
Robot1 is holding Ball4 with its left gripper.
Ball4 is no longer in Room2.
Left gripper of Robot1 is no longer free.
Robot1 moves from Room2 to Room1:

Action: move(robot1, room2, room1)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is in Room2.
Effects:
Robot1 is now in Room1.
Robot1 is no longer in Room2.
Robot1 drops Ball4 in Room1 from its left gripper:

Action: drop(robot1, ball4, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is holding Ball4 with its left gripper.
Robot1 is in Room1.
Effects:
Ball4 is now in Room1.
Robot1 is no longer holding Ball4.
Left gripper of Robot1 is now free.
Final State Achieved:
Ball Positions:

Ball1: Remains in Room2 (as desired).
Ball2: Now in Room1 (as desired).
Ball3: Now in Room1 (as desired).
Ball4: Now in Room1 (as desired).
Robot Positions:

Robot1: In Room1 with both grippers free.
Robot2: Remains in Room1 with both grippers free.
Robot3: In Room1 with both grippers free.
Optimality Explanation:
Total Actions: 9 actions (5 by Robot3, 4 by Robot1).
Efficiency:
Robot3 maximizes efficiency by carrying two balls in one trip.
Robot1 transports the remaining ball, Ball4, minimizing idle time and avoiding additional trips by Robot3.
Resource Utilization:
Utilizing both robots reduces the total number of actions compared to having Robot3 make multiple trips.
Robot2 remains idle as involving it would not decrease the total number of actions.
Conclusion:
By strategically coordinating the actions of Robot3 and Robot1, we have provided an optimal plan that satisfies all the goals with the minimum number of actions. This plan ensures that all balls reach their desired destinations efficiently while making effective use of the available robots and their grippers.

Summary of Actions:
Robot3:

Picks up Ball2 and Ball3 in Room2.
Moves to Room1.
Drops Ball2 and Ball3 in Room1.
Robot1:

Moves to Room2.
Picks up Ball4.
Moves back to Room1.
Drops Ball4 in Room1.
This plan effectively minimizes the total number of actions required to achieve the goal state while ensuring all preconditions and effects of the actions are satisfied according to the domain description.
