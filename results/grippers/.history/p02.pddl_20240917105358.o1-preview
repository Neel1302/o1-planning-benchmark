Certainly! Here's an optimal plan to solve the problem using the minimum number of actions:

Plan Overview:

Robots Involved: Robot1 (Robot2 remains idle)
Total Actions: 8
Strategy: Robot1 transports Ball2 from Room1 to Room2 and then transports Ball1 from Room3 to Room2.
Detailed Action Sequence:

Robot1 moves from Room2 to Room1:

Action: move(robot1, Room2, Room1)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is in Room2.
Effects:
Robot1 is now in Room1.
Robot1 is no longer in Room2.
Robot1 picks up Ball2 with its left gripper in Room1:

Action: pick(robot1, ball2, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball2 is in Room1.
Robot1 is in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot1 is free.
Effects:
Robot1 is holding Ball2 with its left gripper.
Ball2 is no longer in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot1 is no longer free.
Robot1 moves from Room1 back to Room2:

Action: move(robot1, Room1, Room2)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is in Room1.
Effects:
Robot1 is now in Room2.
Robot1 is no longer in Room1.
Robot1 drops Ball2 in Room2 from its left gripper:

Action: drop(robot1, ball2, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is holding Ball2 with its left gripper.
Robot1 is in Room2.
Effects:
Ball2 is now in Room2.
Robot1 is no longer holding Ball2.
Left gripper of Robot1 is now free.
Robot1 moves from Room2 to Room3:

Action: move(robot1, Room2, Room3)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is in Room2.
Effects:
Robot1 is now in Room3.
Robot1 is no longer in Room2.
Robot1 picks up Ball1 with its left gripper in Room3:

Action: pick(robot1, ball1, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball1 is in Room3.
Robot1 is in Room3.
Left gripper of Robot1 is free.
Effects:
Robot1 is holding Ball1 with its left gripper.
Ball1 is no longer in Room3.
Left gripper of Robot1 is no longer free.
Robot1 moves from Room3 back to Room2:

Action: move(robot1, Room3, Room2)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is in Room3.
Effects:
Robot1 is now in Room2.
Robot1 is no longer in Room3.
Robot1 drops Ball1 in Room2 from its left gripper:

Action: drop(robot1, ball1, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is holding Ball1 with its left gripper.
Robot1 is in Room2.
Effects:
Ball1 is now in Room2.
Robot1 is no longer holding Ball1.
Left gripper of Robot1 is now free.
Final State Achieved:

Ball Positions:

Ball1 is in Room2 (as desired).
Ball2 is in Room2 (as desired).
Ball3 remains in Room1 (as initially, but needs to be moved).
Ball4 remains in Room3 (already in the desired location).
Robot Positions:

Robot1 is in Room2 with both grippers free.
Robot2 remains idle in Room3 with both grippers free.
Notes:

Optimality: This plan minimizes the total number of actions (8 actions) by having Robot1 perform all necessary tasks efficiently.
Unused Balls and Robots:
Ball3: The problem statement requires Ball3 to be in Room3, but it is initially in Room1. Since Robot2 is idle, we can utilize it to transport Ball3.
Robot2: To fully satisfy the goal state, we should include actions for Robot2 to move Ball3 from Room1 to Room3.
Additional Actions for Ball3 (Using Robot2):

Robot2 moves from Room3 to Room1:

Action: move(robot2, Room3, Room1)
Preconditions:
Robot2 is in Room3.
Effects:
Robot2 is now in Room1.
Robot2 is no longer in Room3.
Robot2 picks up Ball3 with its left gripper in Room1:

Action: pick(robot2, ball3, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball3 is in Room1.
Robot2 is in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot2 is free.
Effects:
Robot2 is holding Ball3 with its left gripper.
Ball3 is no longer in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot2 is no longer free.
Robot2 moves from Room1 back to Room3:

Action: move(robot2, Room1, Room3)
Preconditions:
Robot2 is in Room1.
Effects:
Robot2 is now in Room3.
Robot2 is no longer in Room1.
Robot2 drops Ball3 in Room3 from its left gripper:

Action: drop(robot2, ball3, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot2 is holding Ball3 with its left gripper.
Robot2 is in Room3.
Effects:
Ball3 is now in Room3.
Robot2 is no longer holding Ball3.
Left gripper of Robot2 is now free.
Complete Final State Achieved:

Ball Positions:

Ball1 is in Room2.
Ball2 is in Room2.
Ball3 is in Room3.
Ball4 remains in Room3.
Robot Positions:

Robot1 is in Room2 with both grippers free.
Robot2 is in Room3 with both grippers free.
Summary:

Total Actions: 8 actions by Robot1 + 4 actions by Robot2 = 12 actions
Optimality: This plan effectively utilizes both robots to achieve the goal state with the minimum total actions required.
Conclusion:

By carefully planning the sequence of actions and efficiently using both robots and their grippers, we've provided an optimal plan to transport all balls to their desired destinations with minimal effort.
