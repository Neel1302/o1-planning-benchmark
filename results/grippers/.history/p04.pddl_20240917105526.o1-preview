Certainly! Here's an optimal plan to solve the problem:

Plan Overview:

Robots Involved: Robot3
Total Actions: 3
Strategy: Use Robot3 to move Ball3 from Room1 to Room3.
Detailed Action Sequence:

Robot3 picks up Ball3 with its left gripper in Room1:

Action: pick(robot3, ball3, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball3 is in Room1.
Robot3 is in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot3 is free.
Effects:
Robot3 is holding Ball3 with its left gripper.
Ball3 is no longer in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot3 is no longer free.
Robot3 moves from Room1 to Room3:

Action: move(robot3, Room1, Room3)
Preconditions:
Robot3 is in Room1.
Effects:
Robot3 is now in Room3.
Robot3 is no longer in Room1.
Robot3 drops Ball3 in Room3 from its left gripper:

Action: drop(robot3, ball3, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot3 is holding Ball3 with its left gripper.
Robot3 is in Room3.
Effects:
Ball3 is now in Room3.
Robot3 is no longer holding Ball3.
Left gripper of Robot3 is now free.
Final State Achieved:

Ball Positions:

Ball1: In Room1 (as desired).
Ball2: In Room1 (as desired).
Ball3: In Room3 (as desired).
Ball4: In Room2 (already in the desired location).
Robot Positions:

Robot1: Remains in Room4 with both grippers free.
Robot2: Remains in Room4 with both grippers free.
Robot3: In Room3 with both grippers free.
Optimality Explanation:

Total Actions: The plan requires only 3 actions, which is the minimal number needed to achieve the goal.
Efficiency: By utilizing Robot3, which is already in Room1 with Ball3, we minimize movement and actions.
Resource Utilization: Robots 1 and 2 remain idle because involving them would not reduce the number of actions.
Conclusion:

By efficiently using Robot3 to transport Ball3 to its destination, we've provided an optimal plan that satisfies all goals with the least number of actions.
