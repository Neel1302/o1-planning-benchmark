Preconditions:
Robot1 is holding Ball2 with its right gripper.
Robot1 is in Room3.
Effects:
Ball2 is now in Room3.
Robot1 is no longer holding Ball2.
Right gripper of Robot1 is now free.
Robot1 moves from Room3 to Room2:

Action: move(robot1, Room3, Room2)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is in Room3.
Effects:
Robot1 is now in Room2.
Robot1 is no longer in Room3.
Robot1 drops Ball1 in Room2 from its left gripper:

Action: drop(robot1, ball1, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is holding Ball1 with its left gripper.
Robot1 is in Room2.
Effects:
Ball1 is now in Room2.
Robot1 is no longer holding Ball1.
Left gripper of Robot1 is now free.
Robot2's Actions:
Robot2 picks up Ball3 with its left gripper in Room2:

Action: pick(robot2, ball3, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball3 is in Room2.
Robot2 is in Room2.
Left gripper of Robot2 is free.
Effects:
Robot2 is holding Ball3 with its left gripper.
Ball3 is no longer in Room2.
Left gripper of Robot2 is no longer free.
Robot2 moves from Room2 to Room3:

Action: move(robot2, Room2, Room3)
Preconditions:
Robot2 is in Room2.
Effects:
Robot2 is now in Room3.
Robot2 is no longer in Room2.
Robot2 drops Ball3 in Room3 from its left gripper:

Action: drop(robot2, ball3, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot2 is holding Ball3 with its left gripper.
Robot2 is in Room3.
Effects:
Ball3 is now in Room3.
Robot2 is no longer holding Ball3.
Left gripper of Robot2 is now free.
Final State Achieved:
Ball Positions:

Ball1: In Room2 (as desired).
Ball2: In Room3 (as desired).
Ball3: In Room3 (as desired).
Robot Positions:

Robot1: In Room2 with both grippers free.
Robot2: In Room3 with both grippers free.
Robot3: Remains in Room1 with both grippers free.
Optimality Explanation:
Total Actions: 9 actions (6 by Robot1, 3 by Robot2).
Efficiency:
Robot1 transports two balls in one trip, minimizing the number of movements.
Robot2 is utilized to transport Ball3 directly to its destination.
Resource Utilization:
Robot1 and Robot2 are used effectively.
Robot3 remains idle, as involving it would not reduce the total number of actions.
Conclusion:
By strategically planning the sequence of actions and utilizing the robots' capabilities, we've achieved all goals with the least number of actions. This plan is optimal given the initial conditions and constraints.

Summary of Actions:
Robot1:

Picks up Ball1 and Ball2 in Room4.
Moves to Room3, drops Ball2.
Moves to Room2, drops Ball1.
Robot2:

Picks up Ball3 in Room2.
Moves to Room3, drops Ball3.
Note: This plan ensures that all balls reach their desired destinations efficiently while minimizing the total number of actions required.
