To solve this planning problem, where the goal is to transport four balls to specific rooms using three robots, an efficient coordination of moves, picks, and drops needs to be implemented. Each robot will be utilized to optimize the number of moves and ensure balls are transported to their respective destinations effectively.

Initial Conditions:
Robot1 and Robot2 are in Room1.
Robot3 is in Room2.
All balls (Ball1, Ball2, Ball3, Ball4) are in Room2.
Goal Conditions:
Ball1 should remain in Room2.
Ball2, Ball3, and Ball4 should be moved to Room1.
Step-by-Step Plan:
Robot3 Actions (in Room2):
Pick Ball2 using the left gripper.
Move from Room2 to Room1.
Drop Ball2 in Room1.
Return to Room2.
Pick Ball3 using the left gripper.
Move from Room2 to Room1.
Drop Ball3 in Room1.
Return to Room2.
Pick Ball4 using the left gripper.
Move from Room2 to Room1.
Drop Ball4 in Room1.
Comments on Robot1 and Robot2:
Robot1 and Robot2 do not perform any moves initially because all the required actions are executed by Robot3, who is already in Room2 with all the balls and needs to move them to Room1. This minimizes unnecessary robot movement and maximizes efficiency.
Optimization Strategy:
Robot3 is used exclusively to transport the balls because it starts in the same room as all the balls, reducing unnecessary travel and movements by other robots.
The plan ensures Robot3 makes only necessary trips between the rooms, carrying one ball at a time, which optimizes the usage of its gripper capacity and minimizes travel.
This plan uses the location advantage of Robot3 to efficiently accomplish the goal with minimal robot movement and maximum effectiveness. All other robots remain idle as their involvement would not contribute to a more efficient solution given the starting conditions and task requirements.
