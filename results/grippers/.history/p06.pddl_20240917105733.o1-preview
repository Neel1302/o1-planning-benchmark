Certainly! Here's an optimal plan to transport ball1 from room1 to room3:

Plan Overview:
Robot Used: robot1
Total Actions: 4
Strategy: robot1 moves to room1, picks up ball1, moves back to room3, and drops the ball.
Detailed Action Sequence:
1. robot1 moves from room3 to room1:
Action: move(robot1, room3, room1)
Preconditions:
robot1 is in room3.
Effects:
robot1 is now in room1.
robot1 is no longer in room3.
2. robot1 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room1:
Action: pick(robot1, ball1, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
ball1 is in room1.
robot1 is in room1.
Left gripper of robot1 is free.
Effects:
robot1 is holding ball1 with its left gripper.
ball1 is no longer in room1.
Left gripper of robot1 is no longer free.
3. robot1 moves from room1 to room3:
Action: move(robot1, room1, room3)
Preconditions:
robot1 is in room1.
Effects:
robot1 is now in room3.
robot1 is no longer in room1.
4. robot1 drops ball1 in room3 from its left gripper:
Action: drop(robot1, ball1, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
robot1 is holding ball1 with its left gripper.
robot1 is in room3.
Effects:
ball1 is now in room3.
robot1 is no longer holding ball1.
Left gripper of robot1 is now free.
Final State Achieved:
Ball Positions:
ball1 is in room3 (as desired).
Robot Positions:
robot1 is in room3 with both grippers free.
robot2 remains in room2 with both grippers free.
Optimality Explanation:
Total Actions: The plan requires only 4 actions, which is the minimal number needed to transport ball1 from room1 to room3.
Efficiency: By using robot1, which ends in the destination room (room3), we minimize the number of moves and actions.
Resource Utilization: Involving robot2 would also require 4 actions but would not offer any advantage over using robot1.
Conclusion:
By following this plan, ball1 is successfully transported to room3 in the most efficient way possible, satisfying the goal with the least number of actions.

Note: The choice of the left gripper is arbitrary in this case since both grippers are free and only one ball is being transported. The plan remains optimal regardless of which gripper is used.
