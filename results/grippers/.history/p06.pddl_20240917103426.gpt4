To achieve the goal state in this planning problem, we need to coordinate the actions of two robots to transport one ball (Ball1) from Room1 to Room3. Hereâ€™s an optimal sequence of actions using the defined move, pick, and drop actions.

Initial Conditions:
Robot1 is in Room3.
Robot2 is in Room2.
Ball1 is in Room1.
Goal Condition:
Ball1 should be moved to Room3.
Step-by-Step Plan:
Robot2 Actions:
Move from Room2 to Room1.
Pick Ball1 in Room1 using the left gripper.
Move from Room1 to Room2.
Move from Room2 to Room3.
Drop Ball1 in Room3.
Comments on Optimization:
Robot1 stays in Room3 and does not perform any actions as it is not optimally positioned to transport Ball1 without requiring an unnecessary return trip.
Robot2 is used for the entire task as it is initially closer to Ball1 and can efficiently move it to Room3 in a straight sequence of actions.
This plan is optimal in terms of minimizing the number of robot movements and the utilization of resources. Robot2 effectively handles the transportation of Ball1, ensuring a direct route from the ball's initial location to its destination without unnecessary actions by Robot1. This strategy maintains an efficient and streamlined approach to achieving the goal state.
