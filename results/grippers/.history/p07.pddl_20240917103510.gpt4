To achieve the goal state in this planning problem, we need to coordinate the actions of three robots to transport three balls to specific rooms. Given the starting positions of the robots and balls, here's an optimal sequence of actions to meet the goal conditions:

Initial Conditions:
Robot1 is in Room4.
Robot2 is in Room2.
Robot3 is in Room1.
Ball1 and Ball2 are in Room4.
Ball3 is in Room2.
Goal Conditions:
Ball1 should be in Room2.
Ball2 should be in Room3.
Ball3 should be in Room3.
Step-by-Step Plan:
Robot1 Actions:
Pick Ball1 in Room4 using the left gripper.
Move from Room4 to Room3.
Move from Room3 to Room2.
Drop Ball1 in Room2.
Pick Ball2 in Room4 using the right gripper (initially or after moving back from Room2).
Move from Room4 to Room3 (if not already there).
Drop Ball2 in Room3.
Robot2 Actions:
Pick Ball3 in Room2 using the left gripper.
Move from Room2 to Room3.
Drop Ball3 in Room3.
Robot3 Actions:
Since there are no balls initially in Room1 and Robot3 is not optimally positioned to assist with the transfers directly, Robot3 can be on standby or assist if needed for handling unexpected scenarios or optimizing further based on real-time conditions.
Comments on Optimization:
Robot1 efficiently uses both grippers to handle Ball1 and Ball2. It performs a sequence of actions that minimize room transitions by first dealing with Ball1 and then using a return trip to handle Ball2, ensuring all movements contribute to goal fulfillment.
Robot2 directly handles Ball3, which is already in its initial room, making a straightforward trip to Room3.
This plan minimizes the number of movements each robot has to make and optimizes the use of their grippers, reducing the potential for operational delays or errors.
This plan ensures that each ball is transported to its required destination with minimal movement and maximized efficiency, using each robot's capabilities strategically to achieve the specified goals.
