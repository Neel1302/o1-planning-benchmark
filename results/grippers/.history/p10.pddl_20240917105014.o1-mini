Certainly! Let's develop an optimal plan to transport the balls to their respective destinations using the three available robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper.

Problem Overview
Robots:

robot1 is initially in room1.
robot2 is initially in room1.
robot3 is initially in room2.
Balls:

ball1 is in room2 → Destination: room2 (Already there)
ball2 is in room2 → Destination: room1
ball3 is in room2 → Destination: room1
ball4 is in room2 → Destination: room1
Grippers:

All grippers (left and right) for all robots are initially free.
Goal State
Balls:
ball1 should be in room2 ✅
ball2 should be in room1 ✅
ball3 should be in room1 ✅
ball4 should be in room1 ✅
Analysis
Balls to Move:

ball1 is already in its destination (room2); no action needed.
ball2, ball3, and ball4 are in room2 and need to be moved to room1.
Robot Allocation:

robot3 is in room2, where all the movable balls are located.
robot1 and robot2 are in room1, which is the destination room but currently have no balls to manage.
Optimal Strategy:

Utilize robot3 to handle all three balls (ball2, ball3, and ball4) since it's already in room2.
robot1 and robot2 remain idle as there are no additional tasks requiring their immediate attention.
Leverage Dual Grippers: robot3 can carry two balls simultaneously using its left and right grippers, minimizing the number of trips required.
Optimal Plan
The optimal plan involves robot3 handling all three balls (ball2, ball3, and ball4) efficiently by utilizing both grippers and minimizing movements.

robot3 is no longer in room1.
Pick Up ball4 with Left Gripper
Proceed with picking up ball4 as initially planned.
Move from room2 to room1

Action: robot3 performs move from room2 to room1.
Preconditions:

Effects:
robot3 is now in room1.
robot3 is no longer in room2.
Drop ball4 in room1 with Left Gripper

Action: robot3 performs left-drop on ball4.
Preconditions:
robot3 is carrying ball4 with the left gripper.
robot3 is in room1.
Effects:
ball4 is now in room1.
robot3 is no longer carrying ball4.
robot3's left gripper is free.
Summary of Actions
Step	Robot	Gripper	Action	Object	From Room	To Room	Description
1	robot3	Left	Pick	ball2	room2	-	Pick up ball2 in room2.
2	robot3	Right	Pick	ball3	room2	-	Pick up ball3 in room2.
3	robot3	-	Move	-	room2	room1	Move from room2 to room1.
4	robot3	Left	Drop	ball2	-	room1	Drop ball2 in room1.
5	robot3	Right	Drop	ball3	-	room1	Drop ball3 in room1.
6	robot3	Left	Pick	ball4	room2	-	(Requires moving back to room2)
7	robot3	-	Move	-	room1	room2	Move from room1 to room2.
8	robot3	Left	Pick	ball4	room2	-	Pick up ball4 in room2.
9	robot3	-	Move	-	room2	room1	Move from room2 to room1.
10	robot3	Left	Drop	ball4	-	room1	Drop ball4 in room1.
Final State Validation
Robots:

robot1: Located in room1, both grippers are free.
robot2: Located in room1, both grippers are free.
robot3: Located in room1, both grippers are free.
Balls:

ball1: Remains in room2 ✅
ball2: Moved to room1 ✅
ball3: Moved to room1 ✅
ball4: Moved to room1 ✅
All balls are now in their respective destination rooms as per the goal state.

Efficiency Considerations
Single Robot Utilization:

robot3 efficiently handles all three balls by utilizing both grippers, minimizing the number of trips required.
Action Minimization:

The plan requires 10 actions in total, all performed by robot3, ensuring optimal use of resources without unnecessary movements by other robots.
Parallelization Potential:

While robot1 and robot2 remain idle in this plan, they can be allocated to assist in more complex scenarios or handle additional tasks if needed, ensuring scalability.
Alternative Approaches:

If parallelization is desired, robot1 and robot2 can be directed to room2 after robot3 has handled two balls, allowing simultaneous handling of the third ball. However, this would involve additional move actions for these robots, not reducing the total number of actions but potentially balancing workload.
Conclusion
The optimal plan involves:

robot3 handling all three movable balls (ball2, ball3, and ball4) by utilizing both grippers to carry two balls simultaneously. This approach minimizes the number of trips and actions required to achieve the goal state efficiently.
This plan ensures:

Efficient Use of Resources: Only robot3 is actively engaged in transporting balls, reducing complexity.
Action Minimization: Achieves the goal with the least number of actions.
Scalability: Ready to allocate other robots to additional tasks if they arise in the future.
