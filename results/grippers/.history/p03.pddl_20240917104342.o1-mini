Certainly! Let's develop an optimal plan to transport ball1 and ball2 to their respective destinations (room5 and room4) using the two available robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper.

Problem Overview
Robots:
robot1 is initially in room1.
robot2 is initially in room2.
Balls:
ball1 is in room1 → Destination: room5
ball2 is in room1 → Destination: room4
Grippers:
All grippers (left and right) for both robots are initially free.
Goal State
Balls:
ball1 should be in room5.
ball2 should be in room4.
Optimal Plan
To achieve the goal efficiently, we'll utilize both robots to parallelize actions where possible. Here's a step-by-step sequence:

Option 1: Single Robot (robot1) Handles Both Balls
This approach leverages robot1's capability to use both grippers simultaneously.

robot1 Picks Up ball1 with Left Gripper

Action: robot1 performs left-pick on ball1.
Preconditions:
ball1 is in room1.
robot1 is in room1.
robot1's left gripper is free.
Effects:
robot1 is now carrying ball1 with the left gripper.
ball1 is no longer in room1.
robot1's left gripper is occupied.
robot1 Picks Up ball2 with Right Gripper

Action: robot1 performs right-pick on ball2.
Preconditions:
ball2 is in room1.
robot1 is in room1.
robot1's right gripper is free.
Effects:
robot1 is now carrying ball2 with the right gripper.
ball2 is no longer in room1.
robot1's right gripper is occupied.
robot1 Moves from room1 to room4

Action: robot1 performs move from room1 to room4.
Preconditions:
robot1 is in room1.
Effects:
robot1 is now in room4.
robot1 is no longer in room1.
robot1 Drops ball2 in room4 with Right Gripper

Action: robot1 performs right-drop on ball2.
Preconditions:
robot1 is carrying ball2 with the right gripper.
robot1 is in room4.
Effects:
ball2 is now in room4.
robot1 is no longer carrying ball2.
robot1's right gripper is free.
robot1 Moves from room4 to room5

Action: robot1 performs move from room4 to room5.
Preconditions:
robot1 is in room4.
Effects:
robot1 is now in room5.
robot1 is no longer in room4.
robot1 Drops ball1 in room5 with Left Gripper

Action: robot1 performs left-drop on ball1.
Preconditions:
robot1 is carrying ball1 with the left gripper.
robot1 is in room5.
Effects:
ball1 is now in room5.
robot1 is no longer carrying ball1.
robot1's left gripper is free.
Total Actions: 6

Option 2: Utilizing Both Robots for Parallel Actions
This approach distributes tasks between robot1 and robot2 to potentially reduce the makespan (total time), assuming actions can be performed simultaneously.

robot1 Picks Up ball1 with Left Gripper

Action: robot1 performs left-pick on ball1.
Preconditions and Effects: Similar to Option 1.
robot1 Moves from room1 to room5

Action: robot1 performs move from room1 to room5.
Preconditions and Effects: Similar to Option 1.
robot1 Drops ball1 in room5 with Left Gripper

Action: robot1 performs left-drop on ball1.
Preconditions and Effects: Similar to Option 1.
robot2 Moves from room2 to room1

Action: robot2 performs move from room2 to room1.
Preconditions:
robot2 is in room2.
Effects:
robot2 is now in room1.
robot2 is no longer in room2.
robot2 Picks Up ball2 with Left Gripper

Action: robot2 performs left-pick on ball2.
Preconditions and Effects: Similar to Option 1.
robot2 Moves from room1 to room4

Action: robot2 performs move from room1 to room4.
Preconditions and Effects: Similar to Option 1.
robot2 Drops ball2 in room4 with Left Gripper

Action: robot2 performs left-drop on ball2.
Preconditions and Effects: Similar to Option 1.
Total Actions: 7 (However, actions can overlap)

Potential Overlapping Schedule:

Step	robot1	robot2	Description
1	Left-pick ball1	-	robot1 picks up ball1 in room1.
2	Move to room5	Move to room1	Both robots move towards their targets.
3	-	-	Continue moving.
4	Drop ball1 in room5	Pick ball2 in room1	robot1 drops ball1; robot2 picks ball2.
5	-	Move to room4	robot2 moves to room4.
6	-	Drop ball2 in room4	robot2 drops ball2.
Makespan: 6 Steps (Comparable to Option 1)

Recommended Plan
Considering both options have a similar number of steps, Option 1 is more straightforward and utilizes robot1's dual grippers efficiently without requiring robot2 to relocate. This minimizes potential delays due to robot movement.

Final Optimal Plan (Option 1)
robot1 performs left-pick on ball1.
robot1 performs right-pick on ball2.
robot1 performs move from room1 to room4.
robot1 performs right-drop on ball2 in room4.
robot1 performs move from room4 to room5.
robot1 performs left-drop on ball1 in room5.
Summary of Actions
Step	Robot	Gripper	Action	Object	From Room	To Room	Description
1	robot1	Left	Pick	ball1	room1	-	Pick up ball1 in room1.
2	robot1	Right	Pick	ball2	room1	-	Pick up ball2 in room1.
3	robot1	-	Move	-	room1	room4	Move from room1 to room4.
4	robot1	Right	Drop	ball2	-	room4	Drop ball2 in room4.
5	robot1	-	Move	-	room4	room5	Move from room4 to room5.
6	robot1	Left	Drop	ball1	-	room5	Drop ball1 in room5.
Final State Validation
robot1: Located in room5, both grippers are free.
robot2: Remains in room2, both grippers are free.
Balls:
ball1 is in room5 ✅
ball2 is in room4 ✅
All balls have been transported to their respective destinations as per the goal state.

Notes:
Efficiency Considerations:

Utilizing robot1's dual grippers allows both balls to be carried simultaneously, reducing the number of trips needed.
robot2 remains idle in this plan, but can be allocated to other tasks or assist if additional objects need to be moved in more complex scenarios.
Alternative Approaches:

If minimizing the makespan (total time) is critical and assuming actions can be performed in parallel, Option 2 utilizing both robots can achieve the same result within the same number of steps. However, it introduces the overhead of moving robot2 to room1.
