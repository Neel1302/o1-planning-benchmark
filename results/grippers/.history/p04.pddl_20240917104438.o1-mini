Certainly! Let's develop an optimal plan to transport the balls to their respective destinations using the three available robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper.

Problem Overview
Robots:
robot1 is initially in room4.
robot2 is initially in room4.
robot3 is initially in room1.
Balls:
ball1 is in room1 → Destination: room1
ball2 is in room1 → Destination: room1
ball3 is in room1 → Destination: room3
ball4 is in room2 → Destination: room2
Grippers:
All grippers (left and right) for all robots are initially free.
Goal State
Balls:
ball1 should be in room1 ✅
ball2 should be in room1 ✅
ball3 should be in room3 ❌ (Needs to be moved)
ball4 should be in room2 ✅
Analysis
Current Positions vs. Goal:

Balls ball1, ball2, and ball4 are already in their respective destination rooms.
Only ball3 needs to be moved from room1 to room3.
Robot Allocation:

robot3 is already in room1, where ball3 is located.
robot1 and robot2 are in room4 and do not need to be involved in this task.
Optimal Plan
Given that only ball3 needs to be moved, the most efficient plan involves a single robot (robot3) performing the necessary actions. Here's the step-by-step sequence:

robot3 Picks Up ball3 with Left Gripper
robot3 Moves from room1 to room3
robot3 Drops ball3 in room3 with Left Gripper
Let's break down each action in detail.

Step-by-Step Actions
robot3 Picks Up ball3 with Left Gripper

Action: robot3 performs left-pick on ball3.
Preconditions:
ball3 is in room1.
robot3 is in room1.
robot3's left gripper is free.
Effects:
robot3 is now carrying ball3 with the left gripper.
ball3 is no longer in room1.
robot3's left gripper is occupied.
robot3 Moves from room1 to room3

Action: robot3 performs move from room1 to room3.
Preconditions:
robot3 is in room1.
Effects:
robot3 is now in room3.
robot3 is no longer in room1.
robot3 Drops ball3 in room3 with Left Gripper

Action: robot3 performs left-drop on ball3.
Preconditions:
robot3 is carrying ball3 with the left gripper.
robot3 is in room3.
Effects:
ball3 is now in room3.
robot3 is no longer carrying ball3.
robot3's left gripper is free.
Summary of Actions
Step	Robot	Gripper	Action	Object	From Room	To Room	Description
1	robot3	Left	Pick	ball3	room1	-	Pick up ball3 in room1.
2	robot3	-	Move	-	room1	room3	Move from room1 to room3.
3	robot3	Left	Drop	ball3	-	room3	Drop ball3 in room3.
Final State Validation
Robots:

robot1: Located in room4, both grippers are free.
robot2: Located in room4, both grippers are free.
robot3: Located in room3, both grippers are free.
Balls:

ball1: Remains in room1 ✅
ball2: Remains in room1 ✅
ball3: Moved to room3 ✅
ball4: Remains in room2 ✅
All balls are now in their respective destination rooms as per the goal state.

Notes
Efficiency Considerations:

Minimal Actions: Only robot3 is utilized since it's already in the correct room (room1) to handle ball3.
Resource Optimization: robot1 and robot2 remain idle, ready to assist if additional tasks arise.
Potential for Parallel Actions:

In scenarios with more tasks, multiple robots could operate in parallel to optimize the makespan. However, since only one ball requires movement in this case, utilizing a single robot is the most efficient approach.
Scalability:

This plan scales efficiently if more balls need to be moved in the future. Additional robots can be allocated to different tasks without causing interference.
Conclusion
The optimal plan involves three actions executed by robot3 to move ball3 from room1 to room3. Since all other balls are already in their destination rooms, no further actions are necessary.

If you have any additional constraints or require further optimizations, feel free to let me know!
