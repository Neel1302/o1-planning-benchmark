Certainly! Let's devise an optimal plan to transport the balls to their respective destinations using the three available robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper.

Problem Overview
Robots:

robot1 is initially in room4.
robot2 is initially in room2.
robot3 is initially in room1.
Balls:

ball1 is in room4 → Destination: room2
ball2 is in room4 → Destination: room3
ball3 is in room2 → Destination: room3
Grippers:

All grippers (left and right) for all robots are initially free.
Goal State
Balls:
ball1 should be in room2 ✅
ball2 should be in room3 ✅
ball3 should be in room3 ✅
Analysis
Current Positions vs. Goals:

ball1 and ball2 are in room4 and need to be moved to room2 and room3, respectively.
ball3 is in room2 and needs to be moved to room3.
Robot Allocation:

robot1 is in room4 where both ball1 and ball2 are located, making it ideal to handle these balls.
robot2 is in room2, the starting location for ball3, allowing it to efficiently move ball3 to room3.
robot3 is in room1, which currently has no balls to manage, so it remains idle unless additional tasks arise.
Optimal Strategy:

Utilize robot1 to pick up both ball1 and ball2 simultaneously using its left and right grippers.
Utilize robot2 to handle ball3 independently.
This parallelization minimizes the total number of actions and the overall makespan (total time to complete all tasks).

robot1's right gripper is free.
Robot2's Tasks (Handling ball3):
robot2 Picks Up ball3 with Left Gripper

Action: robot2 performs left-pick on ball3.
Preconditions:
ball3 is in room2.
robot2 is in room2.
robot2's left gripper is free.
Effects:
robot2 is now carrying ball3 with the left gripper.
ball3 is no longer in room2.
robot2's left gripper is occupied.
robot2 Moves from room2 to room3

Action: robot2 performs move from room2 to room3.
Preconditions:
robot2 is in room2.

robot2 is now in room3.
robot2 is no longer in room2.
robot2 Drops ball3 in room3 with Left Gripper

Action: robot2 performs left-drop on ball3.
Preconditions:
robot2 is carrying ball3 with the left gripper.
robot2 is in room3.
Effects:
ball3 is now in room3.
robot2 is no longer carrying ball3.
robot2's left gripper is free.
Robot3's Status:
robot3 is in room1, which currently has no balls to manage.
Action: No action needed.
Status: Remains idle unless additional tasks arise.
Summary of Actions
Step	Robot	Gripper	Action	Object	From Room	To Room	Description
1	robot1	Left	Pick	ball1	room4	-	Pick up ball1 in room4.
2	robot1	Right	Pick	ball2	room4	-	Pick up ball2 in room4.
3	robot1	-	Move	-	room4	room2	Move from room4 to room2.
4	robot1	Left	Drop	ball1	-	room2	Drop ball1 in room2.
5	robot1	-	Move	-	room2	room3	Move from room2 to room3.
6	robot1	Right	Drop	ball2	-	room3	Drop ball2 in room3.
7	robot2	Left	Pick	ball3	room2	-	Pick up ball3 in room2.
8	robot2	-	Move	-	room2	room3	Move from room2 to room3.
9	robot2	Left	Drop	ball3	-	room3	Drop ball3 in room3.
Final State Validation
Robots:

robot1: Located in room3, both grippers are free.
robot2: Located in room3, both grippers are free.
robot3: Remains in room1, both grippers are free.
Balls:

ball1: Moved to room2 ✅
ball2: Moved to room3 ✅
ball3: Moved to room3 ✅
All balls are now in their respective destination rooms as per the goal state.

Efficiency Considerations
Parallelization:

robot1 handles both ball1 and ball2 simultaneously using its left and right grippers.
robot2 independently handles ball3.
This parallel approach minimizes the total number of actions and reduces the overall time to achieve the goal.
Resource Optimization:

robot3 remains idle as there are no tasks assigned to it in this scenario. This robot can be allocated to other tasks if they arise, ensuring optimal utilization of all available resources.
Action Minimization:

The plan requires 9 actions in total, with each action strategically assigned to minimize redundancy and maximize efficiency.
Alternative Approaches
While the above plan is optimal in terms of action count and efficiency, here are a couple of alternative strategies:

Using robot3 for Additional Tasks:

If there were more balls or additional tasks, robot3 could be utilized to further parallelize actions, potentially reducing the makespan.
Single Robot Handling All Tasks:

Assigning all tasks to robot1 or robot2 would increase the number of actions due to the necessity of sequentially handling multiple balls. This approach is less efficient but might be considered in scenarios where only one robot is preferred or available.
Conclusion
The optimal plan involves:

robot1 handling both ball1 and ball2 simultaneously, moving them to their respective destinations.
robot2 independently handling ball3, moving it to its destination.
robot3 remains idle, ready to assist if additional tasks arise.
This plan ensures efficient use of all available resources, minimizes the total number of actions, and achieves the goal state effectively.
