Given the problem description and the goal, it turns out that the initial state of the world already satisfies the goal state. Both balls (ball1 and ball2) are already in room1, and the goal is for them to be in room1. Since the robots and the balls are already in the correct locations and the robots' grippers are free, no further actions are required.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the situation:

Initial State:

Robot1 is in room1.
Robot2 is in room1.
Ball1 is in room1.
Ball2 is in room1.
Both robots' grippers are free.
Goal State:

Ball1 should be in room1.
Ball2 should be in room1.
Analysis:

The initial state matches the goal state perfectly. Both balls are already in their desired locations (room1), and there are no requirements to change their positions.
Therefore, the optimal plan involves no actions: No Operation Needed. The system is already in the goal state.
