For the given planning problem, we have two robots and a need to transport multiple balls between two rooms. Given the current positions of the balls and the target destinations, here is an optimal sequence of actions that will meet the goal conditions efficiently:

Initial Conditions:
Robot1 is in Room2.
Robot2 is in Room1.
Balls Ball1, Ball2, Ball3, Ball4, and Ball5 are all in Room1.
Goal Conditions:
Ball1, Ball2, Ball4, and Ball5 should be in Room1 (they are already in position).
Ball3 should be moved to Room2.
Step-by-Step Plan:
Robot2 Actions:
Since Ball1, Ball2, Ball4, and Ball5 are already in their target room (Room1) and should remain there, Robot2 does not need to pick or move these balls. Therefore, Robot2 does not need to perform any actions unless assisting with Ball3.
Robot1 Actions:
Move from Room2 to Room1.
Pick Ball3 in Room1 using the left gripper.
Move from Room1 to Room2.
Drop Ball3 in Room2.
Comments on Optimization:
Robot1 performs all the necessary actions to achieve the goal state for Ball3, which is the only ball that needs relocation.
Robot2 remains idle as its assistance is not required for the transport of Ball3 or any other action based on the given goals.
This action plan is optimal because it minimizes the number of movements and actions. Only one robot is actively used, reducing the potential for errors or inefficiencies. This strategy also avoids unnecessary actions by the robots, focusing only on achieving the specified goal with minimal resource usage.
