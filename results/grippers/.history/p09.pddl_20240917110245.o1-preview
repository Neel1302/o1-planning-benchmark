Optimality Explanation:
Total Actions: 19 actions (7 by Robot1, 6 by Robot2, 6 by Robot3).
Efficiency:
Robot1 efficiently transports two balls by combining trips.
Robot2 maximizes efficiency by transporting two balls in one sequence.
Robot3 transports two balls to their destinations in a single trip.
Resource Utilization: All robots are utilized effectively to minimize the total number of actions.
Conclusion:
By strategically planning the sequence of actions and efficiently using the robots' capabilities, we've provided an optimal plan that satisfies all the goals with the least number of actions. This plan ensures that all balls reach their desired destinations while minimizing the total effort.
