For this planning problem, we have three robots each equipped with a left and right gripper and need to transport four balls to specific rooms. Given the initial positions of the robots and balls, we'll coordinate actions to meet the goal conditions efficiently.

Initial Conditions:
Robot1 and Robot2 are in Room4.
Robot3 is in Room1.
Ball1 and Ball2 are in Room1.
Ball3 is in Room1, but needs to be moved to Room3.
Ball4 is in Room2 and should remain there.
Goal Conditions:
Ball1 should be in Room1.
Ball2 should be in Room1.
Ball3 should be in Room3.
Ball4 should be in Room2.
Step-by-Step Plan:
Robot3 Actions:
Pick Ball3 in Room1 with the left gripper (since Ball1 and Ball2 are already at their goal location in Room1).
Move from Room1 to Room2.
Move from Room2 to Room3.
Drop Ball3 in Room3.
Robot1 Actions:
Stay in Room4, no actions needed because there are no relevant balls to move from or to Room4 based on the goal conditions.
Robot2 Actions:
Stay in Room4, similar to Robot1, there are no relevant balls to move from or to Room4.
Comments on Optimization:
Robot1 and Robot2 do not need to move because there are no balls in Room4 that need to be relocated based on the goals.
Robot3 is optimally used to transport Ball3 from Room1 to Room3, ensuring minimal movement across rooms and efficient use of its gripper.
This plan uses minimal robot movement and gripper usage while ensuring that all balls are placed according to their target locations. Each robot performs actions only when necessary, which makes this an optimal solution given the problem constraints.
