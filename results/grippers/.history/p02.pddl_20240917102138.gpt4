To achieve the goal state for the given planning problem, we will need to coordinate the movements and actions of both robots to transport the balls to their designated rooms using their grippers. The plan involves a series of move, pick, and drop actions.

Plan Details
Initial State:

Robot1 is in Room2.
Robot2 is in Room3.
Ball1 is in Room3 (needs to be in Room2).
Ball2 is in Room1 (needs to be in Room2).
Ball3 is in Room1 (needs to be in Room3).
Ball4 is in Room3 (needs to remain in Room3).
All grippers are free.
Action Plan
Robot1 Actions:
Move from Room2 to Room3.
Pick Ball1 in Room3 with the left gripper.
Move from Room3 to Room2.
Drop Ball1 in Room2.
Stay in Room2 (for possible further actions).
Robot2 Actions:
Pick Ball4 in Room3 with the right gripper (to clear space for Ball3).
Drop Ball4 back in Room3 (no need to move).
Move from Room3 to Room1.
Pick Ball3 in Room1 with the left gripper.
Move from Room1 to Room3.
Drop Ball3 in Room3.
Robot1 Continued Actions (if Robot2 not used for this):
Move from Room2 to Room1.
Pick Ball2 in Room1 with the right gripper.
Move from Room1 to Room2.
Drop Ball2 in Room2.
Optimized Coordination
While Robot1 is transporting Ball1 from Room3 to Room2, Robot2 can simultaneously handle Ball3 and Ball4 in Room3 and move to Room1 to pick and relocate Ball3. This reduces waiting times and optimizes the use of each robot's capacity and location.
If there are constraints on simultaneous actions, these steps may need to be serialized to avoid conflicts.
This action sequence uses each robot efficiently, minimizing the total number of room transitions and ensuring that all balls are transported to their required destinations as specified in the goal state.
