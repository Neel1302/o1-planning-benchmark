Certainly! Let's devise an optimal plan to transport ball1 from room1 to room3 using the two available robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper.

Problem Overview
Robots:

robot1 is initially in room3.
robot2 is initially in room2.
Balls:

ball1 is in room1 → Destination: room3
Grippers:

All grippers (left and right) for both robots are initially free.
Goal State
Balls:
ball1 should be in room3 ✅
Analysis
Current Positions vs. Goal:
ball1 needs to be moved from room1 to room3.
Robot Allocation:
robot1 is already in room3 (the destination room).
robot2 is in room2, which is closer to room1 compared to robot1 being in room3.
Optimal Choice:
robot2 is better suited for this task as it needs to perform fewer moves:
Move from room2 to room1 to pick up ball1.
Then, move from room1 to room3 to drop ball1.
Optimal Plan
The optimal plan involves robot2 performing the necessary actions to move ball1 from room1 to room3. Here's a step-by-step sequence:

Step-by-Step Actions
robot2 Moves from room2 to room1
robot2 Picks Up ball1 with Left Gripper
robot2 Moves from room1 to room3
robot2 Drops ball1 in room3 with Left Gripper
Let's delve into each action:

1. robot2 Moves from room2 to room1
Action: robot2 performs move from room2 to room1.

Preconditions:

robot2 is in room2.
Effects:

robot2 is now in room1.
robot2 is no longer in room2.
2. robot2 Picks Up ball1 with Left Gripper
Action: robot2 performs left-pick on ball1.

Preconditions:

ball1 is in room1.
robot2 is in room1.
robot2's left gripper is free.
Effects:

robot2 is now carrying ball1 with the left gripper.
ball1 is no longer in room1.
robot2's left gripper is occupied.
3. robot2 Moves from room1 to room3
Action: robot2 performs move from room1 to room3.

Preconditions:

robot2 is in room1.
Effects:

robot2 is now in room3.
robot2 is no longer in room1.
4. robot2 Drops ball1 in room3 with Left Gripper
Action: robot2 performs left-drop on ball1.

Preconditions:

robot2 is carrying ball1 with the left gripper.
robot2 is in room3.
Effects:

ball1 is now in room3.
robot2 is no longer carrying ball1.
robot2's left gripper is free.
Summary of Actions
Step	Robot	Gripper	Action	Object	From Room	To Room	Description
1	robot2	-	Move	-	room2	room1	Move from room2 to room1.
2	robot2	Left	Pick	ball1	room1	-	Pick up ball1 in room1.
3	robot2	-	Move	-	room1	room3	Move from room1 to room3.
4	robot2	Left	Drop	ball1	-	room3	Drop ball1 in room3.
Final State Validation
Robots:

robot1: Remains in room3, both grippers are free.
robot2: Located in room3, both grippers are free.
Balls:

ball1: Moved to room3 ✅
All balls are now in their respective destination rooms as per the goal state.

Notes
Efficiency Considerations:

Minimal Actions: The plan requires only 4 actions, all performed by robot2, ensuring optimal use of resources.
Robot Utilization: robot1 remains idle in room3, already positioned at the destination, ready to assist if additional tasks arise in the future.
Alternative Approaches:

While it's possible for robot1 to perform the task by moving to room1, picking up ball1, and returning to room3, it would involve similar steps and no additional benefits. Hence, utilizing robot2 is more efficient in this scenario.
Scalability:

This plan scales efficiently for additional balls or tasks. With more balls to move, both robots can be utilized in parallel to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, minimizing the total number of actions and time required.
Conclusion
The optimal plan involves four actions executed solely by robot2 to move ball1 from room1 to room3. Since there are no other balls to move, this plan ensures efficiency and optimal resource utilization.
