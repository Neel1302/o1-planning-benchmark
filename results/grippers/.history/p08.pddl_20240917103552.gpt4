To accomplish the goal state in this scenario, we need to coordinate the movements and actions of three robots to transport five balls between two rooms efficiently. Given the starting locations of robots and balls, hereâ€™s an optimal plan, utilizing move, pick, and drop actions.

Initial Conditions:
Robot1 and Robot3 are in Room2.
Robot2 is in Room1.
Ball1, Ball2, and Ball4 are in Room2 and need to be moved to Room1.
Ball3 is in Room1 and needs to be moved to Room2.
Ball5 is in Room1 and needs to be moved to Room1.
Goal Conditions:
Ball1, Ball2, Ball4, and Ball5 should be in Room1.
Ball3 should be in Room2.
Step-by-Step Plan:
Robot1 Actions:
Pick Ball1 in Room2 using the left gripper.
Move from Room2 to Room1.
Drop Ball1 in Room1.
Pick Ball2 in Room1 using the right gripper (after moving back to Room2 or if not yet moved).
Move from Room2 to Room1 (if not already there).
Drop Ball2 in Room1.
Pick Ball4 in Room1 using the left gripper.
Move from Room2 to Room1.
Drop Ball4 in Room1.
Robot2 Actions:
Pick Ball5 in Room1 using the left gripper.
Drop Ball5 in Room1 (if needed to reposition within the room).
Robot3 Actions:
Pick Ball3 in Room2 using the left gripper.
Move from Room2 to Room1.
Drop Ball3 in Room2.
Comments on Efficiency:
Robot1 performs most of the ball transfers from Room2 to Room1 using both grippers to maximize efficiency.
Robot2 handles Ball5 within Room1 if necessary, using minimal movement.
Robot3 performs the specific task of transferring Ball3 from Room1 back to Room2, ensuring minimal movements and efficient use of its capabilities.
This plan utilizes the robots' location and grippers efficiently, minimizing the movement between rooms and ensuring each ball reaches its designated room. The robots use their dual grippers effectively to streamline the transportation process, maintaining an optimal path for ball relocation. This approach ensures a smooth transition to the goal state with minimal redundancy.
