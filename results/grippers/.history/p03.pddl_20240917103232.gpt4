To achieve the goal state in this problem, both robots will need to coordinate their movements and actions to transport Ball1 and Ball2 to their respective destinations using their grippers. Here's a detailed step-by-step plan using the defined actions (move, pick, drop):

Initial Setup:
Robot1 is in Room1.
Robot2 is in Room2.
Ball1 is in Room1 (needs to be moved to Room5).
Ball2 is in Room1 (needs to be moved to Room4).
All grippers are free.
Step-by-Step Action Plan:
Robot1 Actions:
Pick Ball1 in Room1 with the left gripper.
Move from Room1 to Room2.
Move from Room2 to Room3.
Move from Room3 to Room4.
Move from Room4 to Room5.
Drop Ball1 in Room5.
Robot2 Actions:
Move from Room2 to Room1.
Pick Ball2 in Room1 with the left gripper.
Move from Room1 to Room2.
Move from Room2 to Room3.
Move from Room3 to Room4.
Drop Ball2 in Room4.
Execution Details:
Robot1 directly handles transporting Ball1, making sequential moves through Rooms 2, 3, 4, and finally 5.
Simultaneously, Robot2 moves to Room1 to pick up Ball2, then follows a path through Rooms 2 and 3 to finally drop Ball2 in Room4.
Optimized Coordination:
While Robot1 is busy with its task, Robot2 efficiently uses its time to move and transport Ball2. This avoids any idle time for both robots.
Given the number of moves each robot makes, they both efficiently utilize their time by moving and transporting without any redundant actions or backtracking.
This sequence ensures that each robot performs actions efficiently, moving from room to room without overlap or redundancy, and completes the task of positioning each ball in its designated room. This plan leverages the capabilities of both robots and minimizes the total movement required to achieve the goal.
