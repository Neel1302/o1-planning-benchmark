Certainly! Let's devise an optimal plan to transport ball3 from room1 to room2 using the two available robots, each equipped with a left and right gripper.

Problem Overview
Robots:
robot1 is initially in room2.
robot2 is initially in room1.
Balls:
ball1 is in room1 → Destination: room1 (Already there)
ball2 is in room1 → Destination: room1 (Already there)
ball3 is in room1 → Destination: room2 (Needs to be moved)
ball4 is in room1 → Destination: room1 (Already there)
ball5 is in room1 → Destination: room1 (Already there)
Grippers:
All grippers (left and right) for both robots are initially free.
Goal State
Balls:
ball1 should be in room1 ✅
ball2 should be in room1 ✅
ball3 should be in room2 ✅
ball4 should be in room1 ✅
ball5 should be in room1 ✅
Analysis
Current Positions vs. Goal:

Balls ball1, ball2, ball4, and ball5 are already in their respective destination rooms (room1).
Only ball3 needs to be moved from room1 to room2.
Robot Allocation:

robot2 is in room1 where ball3 is located and can directly handle the task.
robot1 is already in room2, the destination room, and does not need to participate in this specific task.
Optimal Plan
Given that only ball3 needs to be moved, the most efficient plan involves robot2 performing the necessary actions. Here's the step-by-step sequence:

robot2 Picks Up ball3 with Left Gripper
robot2 Moves from room1 to room2
robot2 Drops ball3 in room2 with Left Gripper
Let's break down each action in detail.

Step-by-Step Actions
robot2 Picks Up ball3 with Left Gripper

Action: robot2 performs left-pick on ball3.
Preconditions:
ball3 is in room1.
robot2 is in room1.
robot2's left gripper is free.
Effects:
robot2 is now carrying ball3 with the left gripper.
ball3 is no longer in room1.
robot2's left gripper is occupied.
robot2 Moves from room1 to room2

Action: robot2 performs move from room1 to room2.
Preconditions:
robot2 is in room1.
Effects:
robot2 is now in room2.
robot2 is no longer in room1.
robot2 Drops ball3 in room2 with Left Gripper

Action: robot2 performs left-drop on ball3.
Preconditions:
robot2 is carrying ball3 with the left gripper.
robot2 is in room2.
Effects:
ball3 is now in room2.
robot2 is no longer carrying ball3.
robot2's left gripper is free.
Summary of Actions
Step	Robot	Gripper	Action	Object	From Room	To Room	Description
1	robot2	Left	Pick	ball3	room1	-	Pick up ball3 in room1.
2	robot2	-	Move	-	room1	room2	Move from room1 to room2.
3	robot2	Left	Drop	ball3	-	room2	Drop ball3 in room2.
Final State Validation
Robots:

robot1: Located in room2, both grippers are free.
robot2: Located in room2, both grippers are free.
Balls:

ball1: Remains in room1 ✅
ball2: Remains in room1 ✅
ball3: Moved to room2 ✅
ball4: Remains in room1 ✅
ball5: Remains in room1 ✅
All balls are now in their respective destination rooms as per the goal state.

Notes
Efficiency Considerations:

Minimal Actions: Only three actions are required, all performed by robot2, ensuring optimal use of resources.
Robot Utilization: robot1 remains in room2, already positioned at the destination, ready to assist if additional tasks arise in the future.
Scalability:

Future Tasks: Should more balls need to be moved, both robots can be efficiently utilized in parallel to handle multiple tasks, minimizing the total number of actions and time required.
Conclusion
The optimal plan involves three actions executed solely by robot2 to move ball3 from room1 to room2. Since all other balls are already in their destination rooms, no further actions are necessary.
