Certainly! Here's an optimal plan to transport the balls to their destinations:

Robot1 picks up Ball1 with its left gripper:

Action: pick(robot1, ball1, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball1 is in Room1.
Robot1 is in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot1 is free.
Effects:
Robot1 is holding Ball1 with its left gripper.
Ball1 is no longer in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot1 is no longer free.
Robot1 picks up Ball2 with its right gripper:

Action: pick(robot1, ball2, right_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball2 is in Room1.
Robot1 is in Room1.
Right gripper of Robot1 is free.
Effects:
Robot1 is holding Ball2 with its right gripper.
Ball2 is no longer in Room1.
Right gripper of Robot1 is no longer free.
Robot1 moves from Room1 to Room2:

Action: move(robot1, Room1, Room2)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is in Room1.
Effects:
Robot1 is in Room2.
Robot1 is no longer in Room1.
Robot1 drops Ball1 in Room2 from its left gripper:

Action: drop(robot1, ball1, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is holding Ball1 with its left gripper.
Robot1 is in Room2.
Effects:
Ball1 is now in Room2.
Robot1 is no longer holding Ball1.
Left gripper of Robot1 is now free.
Robot1 drops Ball2 in Room2 from its right gripper:

Action: drop(robot1, ball2, right_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is holding Ball2 with its right gripper.
Robot1 is in Room2.
Effects:
Ball2 is now in Room2.
Robot1 is no longer holding Ball2.
Right gripper of Robot1 is now free.
Summary of the Plan:

Total Actions: 5
Robots Used: Only Robot1 (Robot2 remains idle)
Optimality: This plan minimizes the number of actions by utilizing both grippers of Robot1 to transport both balls in a single trip.
Final State Achieved:

Ball1 is in Room2.
Ball2 is in Room2.
Robot1 is in Room2 with both grippers free.
Robot2 is still in Room1 with both grippers free.
This plan efficiently moves both balls to their desired destinations using the least number of actions.
