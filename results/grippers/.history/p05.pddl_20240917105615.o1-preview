Certainly! Here's an optimal plan to solve the problem:

Plan Overview:
Robots Involved: Robot2
Total Actions: 3
Strategy: Use Robot2 to move Ball3 from Room1 to Room2.
Detailed Action Sequence:
1. Robot2 picks up Ball3 with its left gripper in Room1:
Action: pick(robot2, ball3, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball3 is in Room1.
Robot2 is in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot2 is free.
Effects:
Robot2 is holding Ball3 with its left gripper.
Ball3 is no longer in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot2 is no longer free.
2. Robot2 moves from Room1 to Room2:
Action: move(robot2, Room1, Room2)
Preconditions:
Robot2 is in Room1.
Effects:
Robot2 is now in Room2.
Robot2 is no longer in Room1.
3. Robot2 drops Ball3 in Room2 from its left gripper:
Action: drop(robot2, ball3, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot2 is holding Ball3 with its left gripper.
Robot2 is in Room2.
Effects:
Ball3 is now in Room2.
Robot2 is no longer holding Ball3.
Left gripper of Robot2 is now free.
Final State Achieved:
Ball Positions:

Ball1: Located in Room1 (as desired).
Ball2: Located in Room1 (as desired).
Ball3: Located in Room2 (as desired).
Ball4: Located in Room1 (as desired).
Ball5: Located in Room1 (as desired).
Robot Positions:

Robot1: Remains in Room2 with both grippers free.
Robot2: Now in Room2 with both grippers free.
Optimality Explanation:
Total Actions: Only 3 actions are needed, which is the minimal number required to achieve the goal.
Efficiency: By utilizing Robot2, which is already in Room1 with Ball3, we minimize the number of movements and actions.
Resource Utilization: Involving Robot1 or moving additional balls is unnecessary and would increase the total number of actions.
Conclusion:
By efficiently using Robot2 to transport Ball3 to its desired location, we've provided an optimal plan that satisfies all the goals with the least number of actions. This plan ensures that all other balls remain in their required rooms and that the robots are used effectively.
