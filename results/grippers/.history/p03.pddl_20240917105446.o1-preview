Certainly! Here's an optimal plan to transport the balls to their destinations:

Plan Overview:

Robots Involved: Robot1 (Robot2 remains idle)
Total Actions: 6
Strategy: Robot1 uses both grippers to carry both balls, delivering them to their respective rooms in the most efficient sequence.
Detailed Action Sequence:

Robot1 picks up Ball1 with its left gripper in Room1:

Action: pick(robot1, ball1, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball1 is in Room1.
Robot1 is in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot1 is free.
Effects:
Robot1 is holding Ball1 with its left gripper.
Ball1 is no longer in Room1.
Left gripper of Robot1 is no longer free.
Robot1 picks up Ball2 with its right gripper in Room1:

Action: pick(robot1, ball2, right_gripper)
Preconditions:
Ball2 is in Room1.
Robot1 is in Room1.
Right gripper of Robot1 is free.
Effects:
Robot1 is holding Ball2 with its right gripper.
Ball2 is no longer in Room1.
Right gripper of Robot1 is no longer free.
Robot1 moves from Room1 to Room4:

Action: move(robot1, Room1, Room4)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is in Room1.
Effects:
Robot1 is now in Room4.
Robot1 is no longer in Room1.
Robot1 drops Ball2 in Room4 from its right gripper:

Action: drop(robot1, ball2, right_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is holding Ball2 with its right gripper.
Robot1 is in Room4.
Effects:
Ball2 is now in Room4.
Robot1 is no longer holding Ball2.
Right gripper of Robot1 is now free.
Robot1 moves from Room4 to Room5:

Action: move(robot1, Room4, Room5)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is in Room4.
Effects:
Robot1 is now in Room5.
Robot1 is no longer in Room4.
Robot1 drops Ball1 in Room5 from its left gripper:

Action: drop(robot1, ball1, left_gripper)
Preconditions:
Robot1 is holding Ball1 with its left gripper.
Robot1 is in Room5.
Effects:
Ball1 is now in Room5.
Robot1 is no longer holding Ball1.
Left gripper of Robot1 is now free.
Final State Achieved:

Ball Positions:
Ball1: Located in Room5 (as desired).
Ball2: Located in Room4 (as desired).
Robot Positions:
Robot1: In Room5 with both grippers free.
Robot2: Remains in Room2 with both grippers free.
Optimality Explanation:

Total Actions: The plan requires only 6 actions, which is the minimal number of steps needed to achieve the goal.
Efficiency: By utilizing both grippers of Robot1, we minimize the number of trips between rooms.
Resource Utilization: Robot2 remains idle because involving it would increase the total number of actions without improving efficiency.
Summary:

Actions Performed:
Robot1 picks up Ball1 (left gripper).
Robot1 picks up Ball2 (right gripper).
Robot1 moves to Room4.
Robot1 drops Ball2 in Room4.
Robot1 moves to Room5.
Robot1 drops Ball1 in Room5.
Goals Achieved: Both balls are delivered to their respective destinations in the most efficient manner possible.
Conclusion:

By strategically using Robot1's two grippers and planning the route to minimize movement, we've provided an optimal plan that satisfies all goals with the least number of actions.
