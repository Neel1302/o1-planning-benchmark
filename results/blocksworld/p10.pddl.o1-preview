To solve this blocks world planning problem optimally, we'll devise a sequence of actions that transforms the initial state into the goal state using the least number of actions. The blocks involved are \( b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, \) and \( b7 \).

**Initial State:**

- **Stack A:**
  - \( b1 \) is on the table.
  - \( b7 \) is on top of \( b1 \).
  - \( b4 \) is on top of \( b7 \).
- **Stack B:**
  - \( b5 \) is on the table.
  - \( b2 \) is on top of \( b5 \).
- **Stack C:**
  - \( b3 \) is on the table.
  - \( b6 \) is on top of \( b3 \).
- Clear blocks: \( b4, b2, b6 \).
- The arm is empty.

**Goal State:**

A single stack from bottom to top:

\( b6 \rightarrow b5 \rightarrow b2 \rightarrow b3 \rightarrow b7 \rightarrow b1 \rightarrow b4 \)
