Sure, to achieve the goal state starting from the initial state, the robot can take the following sequence of actions:

1. unstack(b5, b2): Unstack block b5 from block b2. Now the robot arm is holding b5.
2. putdown(b5): Put down block b5 on the table. Now the robot arm is empty and b5 is clear.
3. unstack(b2, b3): Unstack block b2 from block b3. Now the robot arm is holding b2.
4. putdown(b2): Put down block b2 on the table. Now the robot arm is empty and b2 is clear.
5. unstack(b3, b1): Unstack block b3 from block b1. Now the robot arm is holding b3.
6. stack(b3, b5): Stack block b3 on block b5. Now the robot arm is empty and b3 is no longer clear.
7. pickup(b4): Pick up block b4 from the table. Now the robot arm is holding b4.
8. stack(b4, b3): Stack block b4 on block b3. Now the robot arm is empty and the goal state is reached.

Note: The 'on-table' blocks and 'clear' blocks are updated after every action. For example, in action 3, after the unstacking, b3 becomes 'on-table' and 'clear'. Similarly, after action 6, b5 becomes 'not-clear' and b3 is 'not-clear' and 'not-on-table'. It also assumes the arm can only hold one block at a time.
