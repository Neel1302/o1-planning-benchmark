Sure, I can provide a plan to solve the given problem. Here's the sequence of actions that can rearrange the blocks to meet the goal:

1. unstack(b1, b3): The robot arm will pick up block b1 from on top of block b3. After this action, b3 is clear and the arm is holding b1.

2. putdown(b1): The robot arm will then put down block b1 onto the table. After this action, arm is empty, b1 is on the table and b1 is clear.

3. unstack(b3, b2): The robot arm will now pick up block b3 from on top of block b2. After this action, b2 is clear and the arm is holding b3.

4. stack(b3, b4): The robot arm will then stack block b3 on top of block b4. After this action, the arm will be empty, b3 will be on top of b4, and b4 will not be clear.

5. pickup(b1): The robot arm will pick up block b1 from the table. After this action, the arm will be holding b1, and b1 will no longer be on the table or clear.

6. stack(b1, b2): Finally, the arm will stack block b1 on top of block b2. After this action, the arm will be empty, b1 will be on top of b2, and b2 will not be clear.

The final arrangement will have block b2 on top of b1 and block b3 on top of b4, meeting the problem's goals. So, the total number of steps in your plan would be 6.
