Certainly! Below is an **optimal sequence of actions** to transform the initial configuration of the blocks into the desired goal state. This plan ensures that the number of actions is minimized while adhering to the constraints of the defined domain.

### **Initial Configuration:**
- **Stacks:**
  - `b1` is on the table.
  - `b2` is on top of `b1`.
  - `b4` is on top of `b2`.
  - `b3` is on top of `b4`.
  - `b5` is on top of `b3`.
- **Clear Blocks:**
  - `b5` is clear.
- **Arm Status:**
  - The arm is empty.

### **Goal Configuration:**
- **Stacks:**
  - `b1` is on top of `b2`.
  - `b4` is on top of `b1`.
  - `b3` is on top of `b5`.
- **Arm Status:**
  - The arm is empty.

### **Optimal Plan:**

1. **Unstack `b5` from `b3`**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b5, b3)`
   - **Result:** 
     - Arm is holding `b5`.
     - `b3` becomes clear.

2. **Put Down `b5` on the Table**
   - **Action:** `putdown(b5)`
   - **Result:**
     - `b5` is now on the table.
     - Arm is empty.

3. **Unstack `b3` from `b4`**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b3, b4)`
   - **Result:**
     - Arm is holding `b3`.
     - `b4` becomes clear.

4. **Stack `b3` on `b5`**
   - **Action:** `stack(b3, b5)`
   - **Result:**
     - `b3` is now on top of `b5`.
     - Arm is empty.

5. **Unstack `b4` from `b2`**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b4, b2)`
   - **Result:**
     - Arm is holding `b4`.
     - `b2` becomes clear.

6. **Put Down `b4` on the Table**
   - **Action:** `putdown(b4)`
   - **Result:**
     - `b4` is now on the table.
     - Arm is empty.

7. **Unstack `b2` from `b1`**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b2, b1)`
   - **Result:**
     - Arm is holding `b2`.
     - `b1` becomes clear.

8. **Stack `b1` on `b2`**
   - **Action:** `stack(b1, b2)`
   - **Result:**
     - `b1` is now on top of `b2`.
     - Arm is empty.

9. **Pick Up `b4` from the Table**
   - **Action:** `pickup(b4)`
   - **Prerequisites:** `b4` must be clear, which it is.
   - **Result:**
     - Arm is holding `b4`.
     - `b4` is no longer on the table.

10. **Stack `b4` on `b1`**
    - **Action:** `stack(b4, b1)`
    - **Result:**
      - `b4` is now on top of `b1`.
      - Arm is empty.

### **Final Configuration:**
- **Stacks:**
  - `b2` is on the table.
    - `b1` is on top of `b2`.
      - `b4` is on top of `b1`.
  - `b5` is on the table.
    - `b3` is on top of `b5`.
- **Arm Status:**
  - The arm is empty.

### **Summary of Actions:**
1. `unstack(b5, b3)`
2. `putdown(b5)`
3. `unstack(b3, b4)`
4. `stack(b3, b5)`
5. `unstack(b4, b2)`
6. `putdown(b4)`
7. `unstack(b2, b1)`
8. `stack(b1, b2)`
9. `pickup(b4)`
10. `stack(b4, b1)`

This sequence efficiently rearranges the blocks to achieve the desired goal state with **10 actions**, ensuring optimality within the given domain constraints.
