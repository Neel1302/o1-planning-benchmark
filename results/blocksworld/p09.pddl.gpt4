To reorder the blocks we can follow the actions below:

1. unstack the block b4 from b7 (the arm is holding b4)
2. putdown b4 on the table (the arm is empty, b4 is clear)
3. unstack the block b3 from b7 (the arm is holding b3)
4. putdown b3 on the table (the arm is empty, b3 is clear)
5. pickup b7 from the table (the arm is holding b7)
6. stack b7 on top of b4 (the arm is empty, b4 is no longer clear)
7. pickup b6 from the table (the arm is holding b6)
8. stack b6 on top b2 (the arm is empty, b2 is no longer clear)
9. pickup b3 from the table (the arm is holding b3)
10. stack b3 on top of b7 (the arm is empty, b7 is no longer clear)
11. pickup b5 from the table (the arm is holding b5)
12. stack b5 on top of b3 (the arm is empty, b3 is no longer clear)
13. pickup b6 who is on top of b2 (the arm is holding b6)
14. stack b6 on b5 (the arm is empty, b5 is no longer clear)
15. pickup b1 from the table (the arm is holding b1)
16. stack b1 on top of b2 (the arm is empty, b2 is no longer clear)

These steps lead us to an optimal plan to reach the goal state where:
- b1 is on top of b2,
- b2 is on top of b6,
- b6 is on top of b5,
- b5 is on top of b3,
- b3 is on top of b7,
- b7 is on top of b4.
