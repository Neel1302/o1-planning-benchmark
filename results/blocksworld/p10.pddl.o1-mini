Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to achieve the desired goal in the Blocks World domain you described. The plan consists of a sequence of actions that systematically rearrange the blocks from the initial state to the goal state with the minimal number of steps.

### **Action Sequence:**

1. **Unstack b4 from b7**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b4, b7)`
   - **Description:** Remove block `b4` from on top of `b7`. The arm now holds `b4`.

2. **Putdown b4 on the table**
   - **Action:** `putdown(b4)`
   - **Description:** Place block `b4` back onto the table. The arm is now empty.

3. **Unstack b7 from b1**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b7, b1)`
   - **Description:** Remove block `b7` from on top of `b1`. The arm now holds `b7`.

4. **Putdown b7 on the table**
   - **Action:** `putdown(b7)`
   - **Description:** Place block `b7` back onto the table. The arm is now empty.

5. **Unstack b6 from b3**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b6, b3)`
   - **Description:** Remove block `b6` from on top of `b3`. The arm now holds `b6`.

6. **Putdown b6 on the table**
   - **Action:** `putdown(b6)`
   - **Description:** Place block `b6` back onto the table. The arm is now empty.

7. **Stack b5 on b6**
   - **Action:** `stack(b5, b6)`
   - **Description:** Pick up block `b5` (which has `b2` on it) and stack it on top of `b6`. The arm is now empty.

8. **Pickup b3 from the table**
   - **Action:** `pickup(b3)`
   - **Description:** Pick up block `b3` from the table. The arm now holds `b3`.

9. **Stack b3 on b2**
   - **Action:** `stack(b3, b2)`
   - **Description:** Place block `b3` on top of `b2`. The arm is now empty.

10. **Pickup b7 from the table**
    - **Action:** `pickup(b7)`
    - **Description:** Pick up block `b7` from the table. The arm now holds `b7`.

11. **Stack b7 on b3**
    - **Action:** `stack(b7, b3)`
    - **Description:** Place block `b7` on top of `b3`. The arm is now empty.

12. **Pickup b1 from the table**
    - **Action:** `pickup(b1)`
    - **Description:** Pick up block `b1` from the table. The arm now holds `b1`.

13. **Stack b1 on b7**
    - **Action:** `stack(b1, b7)`
    - **Description:** Place block `b1` on top of `b7`. The arm is now empty.

14. **Pickup b4 from the table**
    - **Action:** `pickup(b4)`
    - **Description:** Pick up block `b4` from the table. The arm now holds `b4`.

15. **Stack b4 on b1**
    - **Action:** `stack(b4, b1)`
    - **Description:** Place block `b4` on top of `b1`. The arm is now empty.

### **Summary of the Plan:**

1. **Clear Blocks to Free Up Others:**
   - Remove `b4` from `b7` to make `b7` clear.
   - Remove `b7` from `b1` to reposition it as needed.
   - Remove `b6` from `b3` to prepare stacking `b5` on `b6`.

2. **Rearrange Blocks to Reach the Goal Configuration:**
   - Stack `b5` on `b6` (maintaining `b2` on `b5`).
   - Place `b3` on `b2`.
   - Stack `b7` on `b3`.
   - Place `b1` on `b7`.
   - Finally, stack `b4` on `b1`.

### **Final Configuration:**

After executing the above sequence of actions, the blocks will be arranged as follows to meet the goal state:

- **Table:**
  - `b6`
    - `b5`
      - `b2`
        - `b3`
          - `b7`
            - `b1`
              - `b4`

### **Visualization:**

```
Table
|
├── b6
    └── b5
        └── b2
            └── b3
                └── b7
                    └── b1
                        └── b4
```

This plan ensures that each block is moved efficiently, respecting the dependencies and constraints of the Blocks World domain. By following these 15 actions, you will achieve the desired goal state optimally.
