Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** consisting of six actions to achieve the desired block arrangement. Each step is annotated with the corresponding action and the blocks involved.

### **Initial State:**
- **Blocks:**
  - `b2` is on the table.
  - `b3` is on top of `b2`.
  - `b1` is on top of `b3` (and is clear).
- **Robot Arm:** Empty.

### **Goal State:**
- `b1` is on the table.
- `b3` is on top of `b1`.
- `b2` is on top of `b3`.
- **Robot Arm:** Empty.

### **Plan:**

1. **Unstack `b1` from `b3`:**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b1, b3)`
   - **Preconditions:** 
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b1` is clear.
     - `b3` is clear except for `b1`.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm holds `b1`.
     - `b1` is no longer on `b3`.
     - `b3` becomes clear.

2. **Putdown `b1` on the Table:**
   - **Action:** `putdown(b1)`
   - **Preconditions:** 
     - Arm is holding `b1`.
   - **Effects:**
     - `b1` is on the table.
     - Block `b1` is clear.
     - Arm is empty.

3. **Unstack `b3` from `b2`:**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b3, b2)`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b3` is clear.
     - `b2` is clear except for `b3`.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm holds `b3`.
     - `b3` is no longer on `b2`.
     - `b2` becomes clear.

4. **Stack `b3` on `b1`:**
   - **Action:** `stack(b3, b1)`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is holding `b3`.
     - `b1` is clear.
   - **Effects:**
     - `b3` is on `b1`.
     - Block `b1` is no longer clear.
     - Arm is empty.

5. **Pickup `b2` from the Table:**
   - **Action:** `pickup(b2)`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b2` is clear on the table.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm holds `b2`.
     - `b2` is no longer on the table.

6. **Stack `b2` on `b3`:**
   - **Action:** `stack(b2, b3)`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is holding `b2`.
     - `b3` is clear.
   - **Effects:**
     - `b2` is on `b3`.
     - `b3` is no longer clear.
     - Arm is empty.

### **Summary of Actions:**
1. `unstack(b1, b3)`
2. `putdown(b1)`
3. `unstack(b3, b2)`
4. `stack(b3, b1)`
5. `pickup(b2)`
6. `stack(b2, b3)`

This sequence ensures that each action is valid based on the preconditions and effectively transitions the blocks from their initial arrangement to the desired goal state with the minimal number of steps.
