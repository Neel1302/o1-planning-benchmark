From the description you've provided, it appears that the initial state of the blocks already matches your goal state. Let's summarize to ensure clarity:

**Initial State:**

- **b2** is on top of **b3**.
- **b3** is on top of **b1**.
- **b1** is on the table.
- **b2** is clear.
- Your arm is empty.

**Goal State:**

- **b2** should be on top of **b3**.
- **b3** should be on top of **b1**.

Given that the initial configuration of the blocks already satisfies the goal conditions, no actions are necessary. Therefore, the optimal plan is:

1. **No action required** - The blocks are already arranged as per the goal state.

However, if there was an error in the problem description or if the initial state was intended to be different, please provide the correct initial state, and I would be happy to help you develop an optimal plan to achieve your goal.
