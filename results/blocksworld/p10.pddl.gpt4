Yes, the problem can be solved through the following sequence of actions:

1. **unstack(b6, b3)**: This will remove b6 from b3 and place it in the arm.
2. **putdown(b6)**: This will put b6 down on the table. The arm is now empty.
3. **unstack(b4, b7)**: This will remove b4 from b7 and is now held in the arm.
4. **putdown(b4)**: This will put b4 down on the table. The arm is now empty.
5. **pickup(b7)**: This will pick up b7 from the table into the arm.
6. **stack(b7, b3)**: This will place b7 on top of b3. The arm is now empty.
7. **pickup(b1)**: The arm will pick up b1 from the table.
8. **stack(b1, b7)**: This will place b1 on top of b7. The arm is now empty.
9. **pickup(b4)**: The arm will pick up b4 from the table.
10. **stack(b4, b1)**: This will place b4 on top of b1. The arm is now empty.
11. **pickup(b6)**: The arm will pick up b6 from the table.
12. **stack(b6, b5)**: This will place b6 on top of b5. The arm is now empty.
13. **pickup(b2)**: The arm will pick up b2 from the table.
14. **stack(b2, b5)**: This will place b2 on top of b5 (now b6 and b5 are both below it). The arm is now empty.
15. **pickup(b3)**: This will pick up b3 and the blocks stacked above it from the table.
16. **stack(b3, b2)**: This will place all these blocks on top of b2 (the blocks from b6 to b4 included). Now all the blocks are stacked in the right order. The arm is now empty

In this way, the final goal can be achieved with an optimal plan of 16 steps. 

It's worth noting that 'pickup' and 'putdown' are for blocks on the table, and 'unstack' and 'stack' are for blocks that are on top of one another.
