Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** consisting of **10 actions** to achieve the desired goal in the blocks world domain you've described.

### **Action Sequence:**

1. **Unstack b6 from b4**
   - **Description:** Remove block b6 from atop b4.
   - **Result:** Arm is holding b6; b4 becomes clear.

2. **Putdown b6 on the table**
   - **Description:** Place b6 onto the table.
   - **Result:** Arm is empty; b6 is on the table and clear.

3. **Unstack b5 from b1**
   - **Description:** Remove block b5 from atop b1.
   - **Precondition:** b5 is clear and the arm is empty.
   - **Result:** Arm is holding b5; b1 becomes clear.

4. **Stack b5 on the table**
   - **Description:** Place b5 onto the table.
   - **Result:** Arm is empty; b5 is on the table and clear.

5. **Unstack b1 from b3**
   - **Description:** Remove block b1 from atop b3.
   - **Precondition:** b1 is clear and the arm is empty.
   - **Result:** Arm is holding b1; b3 becomes clear.

6. **Stack b1 on b6**
   - **Description:** Place b1 onto b6.
   - **Result:** Arm is empty; b1 is on b6; b6 is no longer clear.

7. **Unstack b3 from b2**
   - **Description:** Remove block b3 from atop b2.
   - **Precondition:** b3 is clear and the arm is empty.
   - **Result:** Arm is holding b3; b2 becomes clear.

8. **Stack b3 on b5**
   - **Description:** Place b3 onto b5.
   - **Result:** Arm is empty; b3 is on b5; b5 is no longer clear.

9. **Pickup b6 from the table**
   - **Description:** Pick up b6 from the table.
   - **Precondition:** b6 is on the table and clear; the arm is empty.
   - **Result:** Arm is holding b6; b6 is no longer on the table.

10. **Stack b6 on b2**
    - **Description:** Place b6 onto b2.
    - **Result:** Arm is empty; b6 is on b2; b2 is no longer clear.

### **Final Configuration:**

- **On Table:**
  - b2 supports b6
  - b5 supports b3
  - b4 remains on the table

- **Stacks:**
  - **b2** → **b6** → **b1**
  - **b5** → **b3**

- **Arm:** Empty

### **Summary of Goals Achieved:**

1. **b1 is on top of b6**
2. **b3 is on top of b5**
3. **b6 is on top of b2**

### **Visualization:**

```
Table
├─ b2
│  └─ b6
│     └─ b1
├─ b5
│  └─ b3
└─ b4
```

This plan ensures that all blocks are moved efficiently to their desired positions with the minimum number of actions required. Each action carefully respects the preconditions and effect rules of the domain, ensuring the feasibility and optimality of the pl
