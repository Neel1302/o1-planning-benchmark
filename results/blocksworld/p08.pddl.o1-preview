Sure, I can provide an optimal plan to solve the problem by listing a sequence of actions.

**Initial State:**
- Blocks: b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6
- Configuration:
  - b2 is on the table.
  - b3 is on b2.
  - b1 is on b3.
  - b5 is on b1.
  - b4 is on b5.
  - b6 is on b4.
  - b6 is clear.
- Arm is empty.

**Goal State:**
- b3 is on b5.
- b6 is on b2.
- b1 is on b6.
- Arm is empty.

**Optimal Plan (Sequence of Actions):**

1. **Unstack b6 from b4**
   - *Preconditions:* Arm is empty, b6 is clear, b6 is on b4.
   - *Action:* Unstack b6 from b4 (arm now holding b6).
   - *Effects:* b4 becomes clear, b6 is no longer on b4.

2. **Putdown b6 on the table**
   - *Preconditions:* Arm is holding b6.
   - *Action:* Putdown b6 on the table.
   - *Effects:* Arm becomes empty, b6 is on the table and clear.

3. **Unstack b4 from b5**
   - *Preconditions:* Arm is empty, b4 is clear, b4 is on b5.
   - *Action:* Unstack b4 from b5 (arm now holding b4).
   - *Effects:* b5 becomes clear, b4 is no longer on b5.

4. **Putdown b4 on the table**
   - *Preconditions:* Arm is holding b4.
   - *Action:* Putdown b4 on the table.
   - *Effects:* Arm becomes empty, b4 is on the table and clear.

5. **Unstack b5 from b1**
   - *Preconditions:* Arm is empty, b5 is clear, b5 is on b1.
   - *Action:* Unstack b5 from b1 (arm now holding b5).
   - *Effects:* b1 becomes clear, b5 is no longer on b1.

6. **Putdown b5 on the table**
   - *Preconditions:* Arm is holding b5.
   - *Action:* Putdown b5 on the table.
   - *Effects:* Arm becomes empty, b5 is on the table and clear.

7. **Unstack b1 from b3**
   - *Preconditions:* Arm is empty, b1 is clear, b1 is on b3.
   - *Action:* Unstack b1 from b3 (arm now holding b1).
   - *Effects:* b3 becomes clear, b1 is no longer on b3.

8. **Putdown b1 on the table**
   - *Preconditions:* Arm is holding b1.
   - *Action:* Putdown b1 on the table.
   - *Effects:* Arm becomes empty, b1 is on the table and clear.

9. **Unstack b3 from b2**
   - *Preconditions:* Arm is empty, b3 is clear, b3 is on b2.
   - *Action:* Unstack b3 from b2 (arm now holding b3).
   - *Effects:* b2 becomes clear, b3 is no longer on b2.

10. **Stack b3 onto b5**
    - *Preconditions:* Arm is holding b3, b5 is clear.
    - *Action:* Stack b3 onto b5.
    - *Effects:* Arm becomes empty, b3 is on b5.

11. **Pickup b6 from the table**
    - *Preconditions:* Arm is empty, b6 is clear, b6 is on the table.
    - *Action:* Pickup b6 (arm now holding b6).
    - *Effects:* b6 is no longer on the table, arm is holding b6.

12. **Stack b6 onto b2**
    - *Preconditions:* Arm is holding b6, b2 is clear.
    - *Action:* Stack b6 onto b2.
    - *Effects:* Arm becomes empty, b6 is on b2.

13. **Pickup b1 from the table**
    - *Preconditions:* Arm is empty, b1 is clear, b1 is on the table.
    - *Action:* Pickup b1 (arm now holding b1).
    - *Effects:* b1 is no longer on the table, arm is holding b1.

14. **Stack b1 onto b6**
    - *Preconditions:* Arm is holding b1, b6 is clear.
    - *Action:* Stack b1 onto b6.
    - *Effects:* Arm becomes empty, b1 is on b6.

**Explanation:**
- This plan efficiently rearranges the blocks to satisfy all the goals.
- The plan clears the necessary blocks and moves them directly to their goal positions whenever possible.
- By putting down intermediate blocks on the table, we avoid unnecessary movements.
- The plan consists of 14 actions, which is optimal for this problem.

**Final State:**
- b2 is on the table.
- b6 is on b2.
- b1 is on b6.
- b5 is on the table.
- b3 is on b5.
- b4 is on the table.
- The arm is empty.
- All goals are satisfied.

This plan provides the most efficient sequence of actions to reach the goal state from the given initial state.
