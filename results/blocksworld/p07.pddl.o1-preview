To solve the block-stacking problem optimally, we'll aim to reach the goal state in the minimum number of actions. Here's the optimal plan consisting of **eight actions**:

1. **Unstack b5 from b2**
   - *Preconditions*: Arm is empty; b5 is clear; b5 is on b2.
   - *Action*: Unstack b5 from b2.
   - *Effects*: Arm is holding b5; b5 is no longer on b2; b2 becomes clear.

2. **Put down b5 on the table**
   - *Preconditions*: Arm is holding b5.
   - *Action*: Put down b5 on the table.
   - *Effects*: Arm is empty; b5 is on the table and clear.

3. **Unstack b2 from b3**
   - *Preconditions*: Arm is empty; b2 is clear; b2 is on b3.
   - *Action*: Unstack b2 from b3.
   - *Effects*: Arm is holding b2; b2 is no longer on b3; b3 becomes clear.

4. **Stack b2 onto b6**
   - *Preconditions*: Arm is holding b2; b6 is clear.
   - *Action*: Stack b2 onto b6.
   - *Effects*: Arm is empty; b2 is on b6; b6 is no longer clear.

5. **Unstack b3 from b1**
   - *Preconditions*: Arm is empty; b3 is clear; b3 is on b1.
   - *Action*: Unstack b3 from b1.
   - *Effects*: Arm is holding b3; b3 is no longer on b1; b1 becomes clear.

6. **Stack b3 onto b5**
   - *Preconditions*: Arm is holding b3; b5 is clear.
   - *Action*: Stack b3 onto b5.
   - *Effects*: Arm is empty; b3 is on b5; b5 is no longer clear.

7. **Pick up b4 from the table**
   - *Preconditions*: Arm is empty; b4 is clear; b4 is on the table.
   - *Action*: Pick up b4.
   - *Effects*: Arm is holding b4; b4 is no longer on the table.

8. **Stack b4 onto b3**
   - *Preconditions*: Arm is holding b4; b3 is clear.
   - *Action*: Stack b4 onto b3.
   - *Effects*: Arm is empty; b4 is on b3; b3 is no longer clear.

This sequence of actions results in:

- **b5** on the table.
- **b3** stacked on **b5**.
- **b4** stacked on **b3**.
- All other blocks (**b1**, **b2**, **b6**) placed appropriately without interfering with the goal configuration.

By following these steps, we achieve the goal state optimally, moving the blocks to satisfy the required positions with the minimal number of actions.
