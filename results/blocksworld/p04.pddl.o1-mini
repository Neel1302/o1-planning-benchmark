Certainly! Here's an **optimal plan** to achieve the desired block configuration using the available actions. The plan consists of a sequence of **12 actions** that systematically rearrange the blocks from the initial state to the goal state.

### **Initial State:**
- **Stack 1:** b2 (table) → b4 → b1 → b3 (clear)
- **Table:** b2, b4, b1, b3
- **Arm:** Empty

### **Goal State:**
- **Stack:** b4 (table) → b3 → b2 → b1
- **Table:** b4
- **Arm:** Empty

### **Action Sequence:**

1. **Unstack b3 from b1**
   - **Preconditions:** Arm is empty, b3 is clear, b3 is on b1.
   - **Postconditions:** Arm holds b3, b1 is clear.

2. **Putdown b3 on the table**
   - **Preconditions:** Arm holds b3.
   - **Postconditions:** b3 is on the table, arm is empty.

3. **Unstack b1 from b4**
   - **Preconditions:** Arm is empty, b1 is clear, b1 is on b4.
   - **Postconditions:** Arm holds b1, b4 is clear.

4. **Putdown b1 on the table**
   - **Preconditions:** Arm holds b1.
   - **Postconditions:** b1 is on the table, arm is empty.

5. **Unstack b4 from b2**
   - **Preconditions:** Arm is empty, b4 is clear, b4 is on b2.
   - **Postconditions:** Arm holds b4, b2 is clear.

6. **Putdown b4 on the table**
   - **Preconditions:** Arm holds b4.
   - **Postconditions:** b4 is on the table, arm is empty.

7. **Pickup b3 from the table**
   - **Preconditions:** Arm is empty, b3 is clear, b3 is on the table.
   - **Postconditions:** Arm holds b3, b3 is no longer on the table.

8. **Stack b3 on b4**
   - **Preconditions:** Arm holds b3, b4 is clear.
   - **Postconditions:** b3 is on b4, arm is empty.

9. **Pickup b2 from the table**
   - **Preconditions:** Arm is empty, b2 is clear, b2 is on the table.
   - **Postconditions:** Arm holds b2, b2 is no longer on the table.

10. **Stack b2 on b3**
    - **Preconditions:** Arm holds b2, b3 is clear.
    - **Postconditions:** b2 is on b3, arm is empty.

11. **Pickup b1 from the table**
    - **Preconditions:** Arm is empty, b1 is clear, b1 is on the table.
    - **Postconditions:** Arm holds b1, b1 is no longer on the table.

12. **Stack b1 on b2**
    - **Preconditions:** Arm holds b1, b2 is clear.
    - **Postconditions:** b1 is on b2, arm is empty.

### **Final Configuration:**
- **Stack:** b4 (table) → b3 → b2 → b1
- **Table:** b4
- **Arm:** Empty

### **Summary of the Plan:**

1. **unstack b3 b1**
2. **putdown b3**
3. **unstack b1 b4**
4. **putdown b1**
5. **unstack b4 b2**
6. **putdown b4**
7. **pickup b3**
8. **stack b3 b4**
9. **pickup b2**
10. **stack b2 b3**
11. **pickup b1**
12. **stack b1 b2**

This sequence ensures that all blocks are moved efficiently to achieve the desired stack configuration with the minimal number of actions.
