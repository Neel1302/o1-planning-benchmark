Certainly! Here's an **optimal plan** consisting of six actions to achieve the desired goal in the blocks world problem you've described:

### **Action Sequence**

1. **Unstack b₁ from b₃**
   - **Action:** `unstack b1 b3`
   - **Description:** Remove block b₁ from on top of block b₃.
   - **Resulting State:**
     - Arm is holding b₁.
     - b₃ becomes clear.
     - b₁ is no longer on b₃.

2. **Put Down b₁ on the Table**
   - **Action:** `putdown b1`
   - **Description:** Place block b₁ on the table.
   - **Resulting State:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - b₁ is on the table and clear.
     - b₃ remains on b₂.

3. **Unstack b₃ from b₂**
   - **Action:** `unstack b3 b2`
   - **Description:** Remove block b₃ from on top of block b₂.
   - **Resulting State:**
     - Arm is holding b₃.
     - b₂ becomes clear.
     - b₃ is no longer on b₂.

4. **Stack b₃ on b₄**
   - **Action:** `stack b3 b4`
   - **Description:** Place block b₃ on top of block b₄.
   - **Resulting State:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - b₃ is on b₄.
     - b₄ is no longer clear.

5. **Pick Up b₂ from the Table**
   - **Action:** `pickup b2`
   - **Description:** Pick up block b₂ from the table.
   - **Resulting State:**
     - Arm is holding b₂.
     - b₂ is no longer on the table.

6. **Stack b₂ on b₁**
   - **Action:** `stack b2 b1`
   - **Description:** Place block b₂ on top of block b₁.
   - **Resulting State (Goal Achieved):**
     - Arm is empty.
     - b₂ is on b₁.
     - b₁ is not clear (since b₂ is on it).
     - b₃ is on b₄.
     - b₄ remains on the table.

### **Summary of the Plan**

1. `unstack b1 b3`
2. `putdown b1`
3. `unstack b3 b2`
4. `stack b3 b4`
5. `pickup b2`
6. `stack b2 b1`

This sequence ensures that all preconditions for each action are satisfied at every step, leading to the goal state efficiently without any unnecessary moves.
