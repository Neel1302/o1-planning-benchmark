To solve this planning problem optimally, we'll provide a sequence of actions that transforms the initial state into the goal state using the fewest possible steps. Here's the step-by-step plan:

**Initial State:**

- Blocks:
  - `b1` is on `b3` (`on(b1, b3)`)
  - `b3` is on `b2` (`on(b3, b2)`)
  - `b2` is on the table (`ontable(b2)`)
  - `b4` is on the table (`ontable(b4)`)
  - `b1` is clear (`clear(b1)`)
  - `b4` is clear (`clear(b4)`)
- Arm is empty (`empty`)

**Goal State:**

- `b2` is on `b1` (`on(b2, b1)`)
- `b3` is on `b4` (`on(b3, b4)`)

**Optimal Plan (Sequence of Actions):**

1. **Unstack `b1` from `b3`:**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b1, b3)`
   - **Preconditions:** `on(b1, b3)`, `clear(b1)`, `empty`
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm is holding `b1` (`holding(b1)`)
     - `b3` becomes clear (`clear(b3)`)
     - `b1` is no longer on `b3` (`not on(b1, b3)`)
     - Arm is no longer empty (`not empty`)
     - `b1` is no longer clear (`not clear(b1)`)

2. **Putdown `b1` on the table:**
   - **Action:** `putdown(b1)`
   - **Preconditions:** `holding(b1)`
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm becomes empty (`empty`)
     - `b1` is on the table (`ontable(b1)`)
     - `b1` is clear (`clear(b1)`)
     - Arm is no longer holding `b1` (`not holding(b1)`)

3. **Unstack `b3` from `b2`:**
   - **Action:** `unstack(b3, b2)`
   - **Preconditions:** `on(b3, b2)`, `clear(b3)`, `empty`
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm is holding `b3` (`holding(b3)`)
     - `b2` becomes clear (`clear(b2)`)
     - `b3` is no longer on `b2` (`not on(b3, b2)`)
     - Arm is no longer empty (`not empty`)
     - `b3` is no longer clear (`not clear(b3)`)

4. **Stack `b3` onto `b4`:**
   - **Action:** `stack(b3, b4)`
   - **Preconditions:** `holding(b3)`, `clear(b4)`
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm becomes empty (`empty`)
     - `b3` is on `b4` (`on(b3, b4)`)
     - `b4` is no longer clear (`not clear(b4)`)
     - Arm is no longer holding `b3` (`not holding(b3)`)

5. **Pickup `b2` from the table:**
   - **Action:** `pickup(b2)`
   - **Preconditions:** `ontable(b2)`, `clear(b2)`, `empty`
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm is holding `b2` (`holding(b2)`)
     - `b2` is no longer on the table (`not ontable(b2)`)
     - `b2` is no longer clear (`not clear(b2)`)
     - Arm is no longer empty (`not empty`)

6. **Stack `b2` onto `b1`:**
   - **Action:** `stack(b2, b1)`
   - **Preconditions:** `holding(b2)`, `clear(b1)`
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm becomes empty (`empty`)
     - `b2` is on `b1` (`on(b2, b1)`)
     - `b1` is no longer clear (`not clear(b1)`)
     - Arm is no longer holding `b2` (`not holding(b2)`)

**Summary of the Optimal Plan:**

1. `unstack(b1, b3)`
2. `putdown(b1)`
3. `unstack(b3, b2)`
4. `stack(b3, b4)`
5. `pickup(b2)`
6. `stack(b2, b1)`

**Explanation:**

- **Steps 1-2:** We unstack `b1` from `b3` and put it down on the table to make `b1` accessible for stacking and to clear `b3`.
- **Steps 3-4:** We unstack `b3` from `b2` and directly stack it onto `b4`, achieving the goal `on(b3, b4)`.
- **Steps 5-6:** With `b2` now clear and on the table, we pick it up and stack it onto `b1`, achieving the goal `on(b2, b1)`.

This plan requires **six actions**, which is optimal given the constraints of the problem and the necessity to clear certain blocks before moving them.

---

**Note:** Each action is necessary to meet the preconditions for subsequent actions and to achieve the goals. The robot must manipulate the blocks individually due to its limitations (e.g., holding only one block at a time), and the sequence respects these limitations while minimizing the number of steps.

**Final Configuration:**

- `b2` is on `b1` (`on(b2, b1)`)
- `b1` is on the table (`ontable(b1)`)
- `b3` is on `b4` (`on(b3, b4)`)
- `b4` is on the table (`ontable(b4)`)
- `b2` and `b3` are not clear (since they have blocks on top of them)
- Arm is empty

So, the optimal plan to solve the problem is:

1. Unstack `b1` from `b3`
2. Put down `b1` on the table
3. Unstack `b3` from `b2`
4. Stack `b3` onto `b4`
5. Pick up `b2` from the table
6. Stack `b2` onto `b1`
