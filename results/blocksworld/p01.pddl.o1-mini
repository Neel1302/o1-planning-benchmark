Based on the problem description, let's analyze the initial state and the goal state to determine the optimal plan.

### **Initial State:**
- **Blocks Configuration:**
  - **b2** is on top of **b3**.
  - **b3** is on top of **b1**.
  - **b1** is on the table.
- **Additional Conditions:**
  - **b2** is clear (nothing is on top of it).
  - The arm is empty.

### **Goal State:**
- **Blocks Configuration:**
  - **b2** should be on top of **b3**.
  - **b3** should be on top of **b1**.
  - **b1** should be on the table.

### **Analysis:**
Comparing the initial state with the goal state:

- **b2** is already on **b3**.
- **b3** is already on **b1**.
- **b1** is already on the table.
- The arm is empty, and **b2** is clear, which aligns with the goal conditions.

### **Conclusion:**
The initial state **already satisfies** the goal conditions. Therefore, **no actions are required** to achieve the goal.

### **Optimal Plan:**
**No actions needed. The initial state already matches the goal state.**
