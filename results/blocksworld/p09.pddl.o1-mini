Certainly! Here's an **optimal plan** to achieve your goal state in the blocks world problem. The plan consists of a sequence of actions (`pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack`) that systematically rearrange the blocks from their initial configuration to the desired goal configuration.

### **Action Sequence:**

1. **Unstack b4 from b7**
   - **Action:** `unstack b4 from b7`
   - **Description:** Remove `b4` from `b7`, holding `b4` in the arm.

2. **Putdown b4 on the Table**
   - **Action:** `putdown b4`
   - **Description:** Place `b4` on the table, freeing up `b7`.

3. **Unstack b7 from b3**
   - **Action:** `unstack b7 from b3`
   - **Description:** Remove `b7` from `b3`, holding `b7` in the arm.

4. **Stack b7 on b4**
   - **Action:** `stack b7 on b4`
   - **Description:** Place `b7` onto `b4` on the table.

5. **Unstack b3 from b6**
   - **Action:** `unstack b3 from b6`
   - **Description:** Remove `b3` from `b6`, holding `b3` in the arm.

6. **Stack b3 on b7**
   - **Action:** `stack b3 on b7`
   - **Description:** Place `b3` onto `b7` which is already on `b4`.

7. **Pickup b6 from the Table**
   - **Action:** `pickup b6`
   - **Description:** Pick up `b6` from the table, holding it in the arm.

8. **Stack b6 on b5**
   - **Action:** `stack b6 on b5`
   - **Description:** Place `b6` onto `b5` on the table.

9. **Pickup b2 from the Table**
   - **Action:** `pickup b2`
   - **Description:** Pick up `b2` from the table, holding it in the arm.

10. **Stack b2 on b6**
    - **Action:** `stack b2 on b6`
    - **Description:** Place `b2` onto `b6` which is on `b5`.

11. **Pickup b1 from the Table**
    - **Action:** `pickup b1`
    - **Description:** Pick up `b1` from the table, holding it in the arm.

12. **Stack b1 on b2**
    - **Action:** `stack b1 on b2`
    - **Description:** Place `b1` onto `b2` which is on `b6`.

### **Final Configuration:**

- **Table:**
  - `b4`
    - `b7`
      - `b3`
        - `b5`
          - `b6`
            - `b2`
              - `b1`

- **Arm:** Empty

### **Summary of the Plan:**

1. **Unstack** `b4` from `b7`.
2. **Putdown** `b4` on the table.
3. **Unstack** `b7` from `b3`.
4. **Stack** `b7` on `b4`.
5. **Unstack** `b3` from `b6`.
6. **Stack** `b3` on `b7`.
7. **Pickup** `b6` from the table.
8. **Stack** `b6` on `b5`.
9. **Pickup** `b2` from the table.
10. **Stack** `b2` on `b6`.
11. **Pickup** `b1` from the table.
12. **Stack** `b1` on `b2`.

This sequence ensures that each block is moved efficiently to its desired position while respecting the constraints of the blocks world (e.g., a block can only be moved if it's clear and the arm is empty). Following this plan will transition the blocks from the initial state to the goal state optimally.
