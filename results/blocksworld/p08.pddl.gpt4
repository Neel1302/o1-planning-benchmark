Certainly, here is an optimal plan:

1. Unstack b6 from b4 (Now the robotic arm is holding b6 and b4 becomes clear)
2. Putdown b6 on the table (The robotic arm is now empty, and b6 is now clear and on the table)
3. Unstack b4 from b5 (The arm is holding b4, b5 becomes clear)
4. Putdown b4 on the table (The arm is now empty, and b4 is now clear and on the table)
5. Unstack b5 from b1 (The arm is wearing b5, b1 becomes clear)
6. Stack b5 on b3 (The arm is now empty, b3 is no longer clear)
7. Unstack b1 from b3 (The arm is holding b1, b3 becomes clear)
8. Stack b1 on b6 (The arm is now empty, b6 is no longer clear)
9. Pickup b4 from the table (The arm is holding b4, b4 is no longer clear or on the table)
10. Stack b4 on b5 (The arm is now empty, b5 is no longer clear)
11. Pickup b6 from the table (The arm is holding b6, b6 is no longer clear or on the table)
12. Stack b6 on b2 (The arm is now empty, b2 is no longer clear)

Now, the blocks are in this state: 
- b1 is on top of b6, 
- b3 is on top of b5, 
- b6 is on top of b2, 
- b4 is on top of b5. Which meets the goal condition.
