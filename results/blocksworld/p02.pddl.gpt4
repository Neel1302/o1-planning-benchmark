The optimal plan, in the way of a sequence of behaviors, to solve the problem is as follows:

1. The Unstack action: Unstack block b1 from block b3. The result of this action leaves you holding b1, b3 becomes clear, and is still on top of b2.

2. The Putdown action: Putdown block b1 onto the table. After this, b1 becomes clear and on the table, and your arm is empty.

3. The Unstack action: Unstack block b3 from block b2. The result leaves you holding b3, b2 becomes clear and is still on the table.

4. The Stack action: Stack block b3 onto block b1. The result is that b1 becomes the base for b3, your arm is empty, and b3 is no longer clear.

5. The Stack action: Finally, stack block b2 onto block b3. The result is that b2 is stacked onto b3, arm is empty, and b3 is no longer clear. You've reached your goal state.

The key to this problem is to make sure that you make the most of each action and not to pick up a block until it's time to move it to its final location. This plan does this by only picking up each block once.
