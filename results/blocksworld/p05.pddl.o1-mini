Certainly! Let's outline an **optimal plan** to achieve the goal state using the available actions: `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, and `unstack`. 

### **Initial State:**
- **Blocks Configuration:**
  - `b5` is on the table.
  - `b3` is on `b5`.
  - `b2` is on `b3`.
  - `b1` is on `b2`.
  - `b4` is on `b1`.
- **Arm Status:** Empty.
- **Clear Blocks:** `b4`.

### **Goal State:**
- **Blocks Configuration:**
  - `b5` remains on the table.
  - `b3` is on `b5`.
  - `b1` is on `b3`.
- **Other Blocks:** `b2` and `b4` are placed on the table.
- **Arm Status:** Empty.

### **Optimal Action Sequence:**

1. **Unstack `b4` from `b1`:**
   - **Action:** `unstack b4 from b1`
   - **Preconditions:** 
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b4` is clear.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm holds `b4`.
     - `b1` becomes clear.

2. **Putdown `b4` on the Table:**
   - **Action:** `putdown b4`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is holding `b4`.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b4` is on the table.
     - `b4` is clear.

3. **Unstack `b1` from `b2`:**
   - **Action:** `unstack b1 from b2`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b1` is clear.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm holds `b1`.
     - `b2` becomes clear.

4. **Putdown `b1` on the Table:**
   - **Action:** `putdown b1`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is holding `b1`.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b1` is on the table.
     - `b1` is clear.

5. **Unstack `b2` from `b3`:**
   - **Action:** `unstack b2 from b3`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b2` is clear.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm holds `b2`.
     - `b3` becomes clear.

6. **Putdown `b2` on the Table:**
   - **Action:** `putdown b2`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is holding `b2`.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b2` is on the table.
     - `b2` is clear.

7. **Pickup `b1` from the Table:**
   - **Action:** `pickup b1`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b1` is on the table.
     - `b1` is clear.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm holds `b1`.
     - `b1` is no longer on the table.

8. **Stack `b1` on `b3`:**
   - **Action:** `stack b1 on b3`
   - **Preconditions:**
     - Arm is holding `b1`.
     - `b3` is clear.
   - **Effects:**
     - Arm is empty.
     - `b1` is on `b3`.
     - `b3` is no longer clear.

### **Summary of Actions:**
1. `unstack b4 from b1`
2. `putdown b4`
3. `unstack b1 from b2`
4. `putdown b1`
5. `unstack b2 from b3`
6. `putdown b2`
7. `pickup b1`
8. `stack b1 on b3`

This sequence efficiently reorganizes the blocks to achieve the desired configuration with the **minimal number of actions (8 steps)**.
