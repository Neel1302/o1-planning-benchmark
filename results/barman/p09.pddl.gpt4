Given the problem description, it seems like cocktails 1, 2, 4, 5 require the same ingredients, ingredient1 and ingredient3, but in different glasses, while cocktail 3 requires ingredient1 and ingredient2. Here is a sequence of actions you can take to make all 5 cocktails:

1. Grasp shot glass 1.
2. Fill shot glass 1 with ingredient1 using dispenser 1.
3. Pour ingredient1 from shot glass 1 to the shaker.
4. Leave shot glass 1 on the table.
5. Grasp shot glass 2.
6. Fill shot glass 2 with ingredient3 using dispenser 3.
7. Pour ingredient3 from shot glass 2 to the shaker.
8. Shake the cocktail in the shaker. 
9. Pour from the shaker to shot glass 1.
10. Leave shaker on the table.

At this point, cocktail1 has been made. Repeat this process for cocktail2 in shot4 keeping in mind that the shot glass and shaker should be cleaned and emptied before use:

11. Empty and clean the shaker.
12. Grasp, fill, pour ingredient1 using shot glass 4, and leave shot glass 4 on the table.
13. Grasp, fill, pour ingredient3 using shot glass 2, and leave shot glass 2 on the table.
14. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
15. Pour from the shaker to shot glass 4.
16. Leave shaker on the table.

Cocktail2 is now ready. For cocktail3 in shot2, you will need to use ingredient1 and ingredient2:

17. Empty and clean the shaker.
18. Grasp, fill, pour ingredient1 using shot glass 1, and leave shot glass 1 on the table.
19. Grasp, fill, pour ingredient2 using shot glass 3, and leave shot glass 3 on the table.
20. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
21. Pour from the shaker to shot glass 2.
22. Leave shaker on the table.

Cocktail3 is ready. Now, repeat the process for cocktails 4 and 5, which have the same ingredients as cocktail1:

23. Empty and clean the shaker.
24. Grasp, fill, pour ingredient1 using shot glass 5, and leave shot glass 5 on the table.
25. Grasp, fill, pour ingredient3 using shot glass 2, and leave shot glass 2 on the table.
26. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
27. Pour from the shaker to shot glass 3.
28. Leave shaker on the table.
29. Empty and clean the shaker.
30. Grasp, fill, pour ingredient1 using shot glass 1, and leave shot glass 1 on the table.
31. Grasp, fill, pour ingredient3 using shot glass 2, and leave shot glass 2 on the table.
32. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
33. Pour from the shaker to shot glass 5.
