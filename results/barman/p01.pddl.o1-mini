Certainly! Below is an **optimal sequence of actions** for the robot barman to prepare the three desired cocktails: `cocktail1`, `cocktail2`, and `cocktail3`. The plan leverages both hands to maximize efficiency while adhering to all specified constraints.

### **Assumptions:**
- **Hands:** Left (L) and Right (R)
- **Containers:**
  - **Shaker:** S
  - **Shot Glasses:** shot1, shot2, shot3, shot4
- **Ingredients:**
  - ingredient1 (I1)
  - ingredient2 (I2)
  - ingredient3 (I3)

### **Cocktail Definitions:**
- **cocktail1:** I1 + I3 → to be poured into **shot1**
- **cocktail2:** I2 + I3 → to be poured into **shot3**
- **cocktail3:** I1 + I2 → to be poured into **shot2**

### **Initial State:**
- All containers (S, shot1, shot2, shot3, shot4) are **clean**, **empty**, and **placed on the table**.
- Both hands (L and R) are **empty**.

### **Action Sequence:**

1. **Grasp S with Left Hand (L).**
   - *L holds S.*
   
2. **Grasp shot1 with Right Hand (R).**
   - *R holds shot1.*

   - *shot1 contains I1.*

4. **Pour I1 from shot1 to S.**
   - *S contains I1.*
   - *shot1 is now empty.*

5. **Leave shot1 on the table (R).**
   - *R is now empty.*
   - *shot1 is empty on the table.*

6. **Grasp shot4 with Right Hand (R).**
   - *R holds shot4.*

7. **Fill shot4 with I3 using dispenser3.**
   - *shot4 contains I3.*

8. **Pour I3 from shot4 to S.**
   - *S contains I1 + I3.*
   - *shot4 is now empty.*

9. **Shake cocktail in S.**
   - *S now contains cocktail1 (I1 + I3).*

10. **Pour cocktail1 from S to shot1.**
    - *shot1 contains cocktail1.*
    - *S is now empty and clean.*
    - *R holds shot1.*

11. **Leave S on the table (L).**
    - *L is now empty.*
    - *S is empty on the table.*
    - *R holds shot1.*

12. **Grasp S with Left Hand (L).**
    - *L holds S.*

13. **Grasp shot2 with Right Hand (R).**
    - *R holds shot2.*

14. **Fill shot2 with I1 using dispenser1.**
    - *shot2 contains I1.*

15. **Pour I1 from shot2 to S.**
    - *S contains I1.*
    - *shot2 is now empty.*

16. **Leave shot2 on the table (R).**
    - *R is now empty.*
    - *shot2 is empty on the table.*

17. **Grasp shot3 with Right Hand (R).**
    - *R holds shot3.*

18. **Fill shot3 with I2 using dispenser2.**
    - *shot3 contains I2.*

19. **Pour I2 from shot3 to S.**
    - *S contains I1 + I2.*
    - *shot3 is now empty.*

20. **Shake cocktail in S.**
    - *S now contains cocktail3 (I1 + I2).*

21. **Pour cocktail3 from S to shot2.**
    - *shot2 contains cocktail3.*
    - *S is now empty and clean.*
    - *R holds shot2.*

22. **Leave S on the table (L).**
    - *L is now empty.*
    - *S is empty on the table.*
    - *R holds shot2.*

23. **Grasp S with Left Hand (L).**
    - *L holds S.*

24. **Grasp shot3 with Right Hand (R).**
    - *R holds shot3.*

25. **Fill shot3 with I2 using dispenser2.**
    - *shot3 contains I2.*

26. **Pour I2 from shot3 to S.**
    - *S contains I2.*
    - *shot3 is now empty.*

27. **Leave shot3 on the table (R).**
    - *R is now empty.*
    - *shot3 is empty on the table.*

28. **Grasp shot4 with Right Hand (R).**
    - *R holds shot4.*

29. **Fill shot4 with I3 using dispenser3.**
    - *shot4 contains I3.*

30. **Pour I3 from shot4 to S.**
    - *S contains I2 + I3.*
    - *shot4 is now empty.*

31. **Shake cocktail in S.**
    - *S now contains cocktail2 (I2 + I3).*

32. **Pour cocktail2 from S to shot3.**
    - *shot3 contains cocktail2.*
    - *S is now empty and clean.*
    - *R holds shot3.*

33. **Leave S on the table (L).**
    - *L is now empty.*
    - *S is empty on the table.*
    - *R holds shot3.*

### **Final State:**
- **shot1:** cocktail1 (I1 + I3)
- **shot2:** cocktail3 (I1 + I2)
- **shot3:** cocktail2 (I2 + I3)
- **shot4:** Empty and clean
- **Shaker (S):** Empty and clean
- **Hands:** Both Left (L) and Right (R) are empty or holding their respective final shot glasses.

---

### **Summary of Actions:**
- **Total Actions:** 33
- **Key Strategies:**
  - **Hand Utilization:** Alternated between both hands to prepare multiple components concurrently.
  - **Container Management:** Efficiently used shot4 as a temporary container to hold ingredients and minimize container switching.
  - **Shaker Reuse:** Emptied and cleaned the shaker after each cocktail preparation to facilitate subsequent uses without additional cleaning steps.

This plan ensures that all three cocktails are prepared optimally within the constraints, utilizing both hands effectively and minimizing the total number of actions required.
