Sure. Here is the plan:

1. Grasp the shot glass1 with the left hand. 
2. Fill shot glass1 with ingredient2 from the dispenser.
3. Grasp shaker with the right hand.
4. Pour ingredient2 from shot glass1 to the shaker.
5. Leave the shot glass1 on the table.
6. Grasp the shot glass2 with the left hand. 
7. Fill shot glass2 with ingredient3 from the dispenser.
8. Pour ingredient3 from shot glass2 to the shaker.
9. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
10. Pour from the shaker to the shot glass1.
11. Empty the shaker.
12. Leave the shaker on the table.
13. Leave the shot glass1 on the table.

The cocktail1 in shot glass1 is ready. Repeat these 13 steps for the other two shot glasses adjusting ingredients for each cocktail.

For shot glass2 fill shot glass with ingredient1 pour into shaker, then fill shot glass with ingredient3 pour into shaker and continue with the original sequence from step 9.

For shot glass3 fill shot glass with ingredient2 pour into shaker, then fill shot glass with ingredient1 pour into shaker and continue with the original sequence from step 9.

This would be the most optimal plan given the constraints of action described for the robot.
