To solve this problem optimally, we'll craft a plan that efficiently uses the available shot glasses and shaker while adhering to the given preconditions and constraints. We'll strategically clean and reuse shot glasses when necessary to minimize the number of steps. Here's the step-by-step plan to prepare the three cocktails:

**Initial State:**
- **Shaker (S1):** Empty, clean, on the table.
- **Shot Glasses (SG1, SG2, SG3, SG4):** Empty, clean, on the table.
- **Dispensers:** Ingredients 1, 2, and 3.
- **Hands:** Both hands empty.

### **Preparing Cocktail1 (Ingredient1 + Ingredient3 in Shot Glass for Cocktail1):**

1. **Grasp SG1** with left hand.
2. **Fill SG1 with Ingredient1** (requires right hand empty, SG1 is empty and clean).
3. **Leave SG1** on the table (left hand becomes empty).
4. **Grasp SG2** with left hand.
5. **Fill SG2 with Ingredient3** (requires right hand empty, SG2 is empty and clean).
6. **Leave SG2** on the table (left hand becomes empty).

7. **Grasp SG1** with left hand.
8. **Grasp Shaker (S1)** with right hand (both hands now occupied).
9. **Pour Ingredient1 from SG1 to S1** (SG1 becomes empty; S1 now contains Ingredient1 at level 1).
10. **Leave SG1** on the table (left hand becomes empty).
11. **Grasp SG2** with left hand.
12. **Pour Ingredient3 from SG2 to S1** (SG2 becomes empty; S1 now contains Ingredient3 at level 2).
13. **Leave SG2** on the table (left hand becomes empty).

14. **Shake S1** (requires holding shaker with one hand, other hand empty; S1 now contains Cocktail1).
15. **Grasp SG3** with left hand.
16. **Clean SG3** (ensures SG3 is empty and clean for the cocktail).
17. **Pour Cocktail1 from S1 to SG3** (SG3 now contains Cocktail1; S1's level decreases).
18. **Leave SG3** on the table (left hand becomes empty).

19. **Empty S1** (requires holding S1; S1 becomes empty and unshaked).
20. **Clean S1** (ensures S1 is clean for the next cocktail).
21. **Leave S1** on the table (right hand becomes empty).

### **Preparing Cocktail2 (Ingredient2 + Ingredient3 in Shot Glass for Cocktail2):**

22. **Grasp SG1** with left hand.
23. **Clean SG1** (ensures SG1 is empty and clean).
24. **Fill SG1 with Ingredient2**.
25. **Leave SG1** on the table.
26. **Grasp SG2** with left hand.
27. **Clean SG2**.
28. **Fill SG2 with Ingredient3**.
29. **Leave SG2** on the table.

30. **Grasp SG1** with left hand.
31. **Grasp S1** with right hand.
32. **Pour Ingredient2 from SG1 to S1** (SG1 becomes empty; S1 contains Ingredient2 at level 1).
33. **Leave SG1** on the table.
34. **Grasp SG2** with left hand.
35. **Pour Ingredient3 from SG2 to S1** (SG2 becomes empty; S1 contains Ingredient3 at level 2).
36. **Leave SG2** on the table.

37. **Shake S1** (S1 now contains Cocktail2).
38. **Grasp SG4** with left hand.
39. **Clean SG4**.
40. **Pour Cocktail2 from S1 to SG4** (SG4 now contains Cocktail2).
41. **Leave SG4** on the table.

42. **Empty S1**.
43. **Clean S1**.
44. **Leave S1** on the table.

### **Preparing Cocktail3 (Ingredient2 + Ingredient1 in Shot Glass for Cocktail3):**

45. **Grasp SG2** with left hand.
46. **Clean SG2**.
47. **Fill SG2 with Ingredient2**.
48. **Leave SG2** on the table.
49. **Grasp SG1** with left hand.
50. **Clean SG1**.
51. **Fill SG1 with Ingredient1**.
52. **Leave SG1** on the table.

53. **Grasp SG2** with left hand.
54. **Grasp S1** with right hand.
55. **Pour Ingredient2 from SG2 to S1** (SG2 becomes empty; S1 contains Ingredient2 at level 1).
56. **Leave SG2** on the table.
57. **Grasp SG1** with left hand.
58. **Pour Ingredient1 from SG1 to S1** (SG1 becomes empty; S1 contains Ingredient1 at level 2).
59. **Leave SG1** on the table.

60. **Shake S1** (S1 now contains Cocktail3).
61. **Grasp SG3** with left hand.
62. **Clean SG3** (since SG3 was previously used for Cocktail1).
63. **Pour Cocktail3 from S1 to SG3** (SG3 now contains Cocktail3).
64. **Leave SG3** on the table.

65. **Empty S1**.
66. **Clean S1**.
67. **Leave S1** on the table.

**Final State:**
- **SG3** contains **Cocktail1**.
- **SG4** contains **Cocktail2**.
- **SG3** (after cleaning and reuse) contains **Cocktail3**.
- All cocktails are prepared, and the goal is achieved.

**Notes:**
- **Shot Glass Reuse:** We cleaned and reused shot glasses (SG1, SG2, SG3) to handle the limited number of shot glasses.
- **Cleaning Steps:** Cleaning was necessary whenever a shot glass that had been used needed to be used again for a different ingredient or cocktail.
- **Hand Management:** We ensured that preconditions regarding hand occupancy were always met.

This plan minimizes the number of actions by efficiently reusing shot glasses and properly sequencing the steps while following all the given rules and constraints.
