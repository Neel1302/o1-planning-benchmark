**Note:**

- The plan minimizes the number of actions by reusing shot glasses where appropriate and ensuring that the preconditions for each action are met.
- The Shaker is cleaned between preparing different cocktails to meet the precondition that it must be clean and empty before preparing a new cocktail.
- Shot glasses used to pour ingredients remain clean and can be reused for serving if they meet the preconditions.
- This plan ensures that all five cocktails are prepared and served in their designated shot glasses with optimal efficiency.
