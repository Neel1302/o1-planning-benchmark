To solve this problem optimally, we need to make four cocktails using the robot's actions efficiently while adhering to the constraints. Here's the step-by-step plan:

**Initial State:**
- You have 1 shaker with 3 levels (empty, clean, on the table).
- 5 shot glasses (empty, clean, on the table).
- 3 dispensers for ingredients 1, 2, and 3.
- Your left and right hands are empty.
- The goal is to make:
  - **Shot1** contains **Cocktail2** (Ingredient2 + Ingredient1).
  - **Shot2** contains **Cocktail3** (Ingredient1 + Ingredient2).
  - **Shot3** contains **Cocktail1** (Ingredient3 + Ingredient1).
  - **Shot4** contains **Cocktail4** (Ingredient2 + Ingredient3).

### **Making Cocktail2 and Cocktail3 (They have the same ingredients):**

**1.** **Grasp** a clean shot glass (Shot Glass A) with your **right hand**.

**2.** **Fill** Shot Glass A with **Ingredient1** (your left hand is empty).

**3.** **Grasp** the shaker with your **left hand**.

**4.** **Pour** from Shot Glass A to the shaker (shaker is empty and clean).

**5.** The shot glass (Shot Glass A) is now empty.

**6.** **Fill** Shot Glass A with **Ingredient2** (since it's still clean and your left hand is holding the shaker).

   - **Note:** Before filling, you need your other hand to be empty. So you need to **leave** the shaker on the table:

     - **6a.** **Leave** the shaker on the table (your left hand becomes empty).

   - Now, **fill** Shot Glass A with **Ingredient2**.

**7.** **Grasp** the shaker again with your **left hand**.

**8.** **Pour** from Shot Glass A to the shaker (shaker is unshaked and not full).

**9.** The shot glass (Shot Glass A) is now empty.

**10.** **Shake** the shaker (your other hand is empty).

**11.** **Grasp** a clean shot glass (Shot Glass B) with your **right hand**.

**12.** **Pour** from the shaker to Shot Glass B (now contains **Cocktail2**, which will be **Shot1**).

**13.** **Grasp** another clean shot glass (Shot Glass C) with your **right hand**.

**14.** **Pour** from the shaker to Shot Glass C (now contains **Cocktail3**, which will be **Shot2**).

**15.** The shaker is now empty (level reduced to 0).

---

### **Preparing for the Next Cocktail:**

**16.** **Empty** the shaker (though it's already empty, this resets its state).

**17.** **Clean** the shaker (your other hand is empty).

---

### **Making Cocktail1:**

**18.** **Grasp** a clean shot glass (Shot Glass A) with your **right hand**.

**19.** **Fill** Shot Glass A with **Ingredient3**.

**20.** **Grasp** the shaker with your **left hand**.

**21.** **Pour** from Shot Glass A to the shaker.

**22.** The shot glass (Shot Glass A) is now empty.

**23.** **Leave** the shaker on the table (your left hand becomes empty).

**24.** **Fill** Shot Glass A with **Ingredient1**.

**25.** **Grasp** the shaker with your **left hand**.

**26.** **Pour** from Shot Glass A to the shaker.

**27.** The shot glass (Shot Glass A) is now empty.

**28.** **Shake** the shaker.

**29.** **Grasp** a clean shot glass (Shot Glass D) with your **right hand**.

**30.** **Pour** from the shaker to Shot Glass D (now contains **Cocktail1**, which will be **Shot3**).

---

### **Preparing for the Next Cocktail:**

**31.** **Empty** the shaker.

**32.** **Clean** the shaker.

---

### **Making Cocktail4:**

**33.** **Grasp** a clean shot glass (Shot Glass A) with your **right hand**.

**34.** **Fill** Shot Glass A with **Ingredient2**.

**35.** **Grasp** the shaker with your **left hand**.

**36.** **Pour** from Shot Glass A to the shaker.

**37.** The shot glass (Shot Glass A) is now empty.

**38.** **Leave** the shaker on the table (your left hand becomes empty).

**39.** **Fill** Shot Glass A with **Ingredient3**.

**40.** **Grasp** the shaker with your **left hand**.

**41.** **Pour** from Shot Glass A to the shaker.

**42.** The shot glass (Shot Glass A) is now empty.

**43.** **Shake** the shaker.

**44.** **Grasp** a clean shot glass (Shot Glass E) with your **right hand**.

**45.** **Pour** from the shaker to Shot Glass E (now contains **Cocktail4**, which will be **Shot4**).

---

### **Final Steps:**

**46.** **Empty** the shaker.

**47.** **Clean** the shaker (optional if we're done).

---

**Total Actions:** 47 actions.

---

**Explanation:**

- We combined the making of **Cocktail2** and **Cocktail3** since they have the same ingredients.
- Reused the same shot glass where possible to minimize the number of actions.
- Ensured we always met the constraints, like having an empty other hand when required.
- Cleaned the shaker between cocktails because we can't mix different cocktails in the same shaker without cleaning.
- Used only the necessary actions, avoiding any unnecessary steps.

**Optimality:**

Given the constraints and the need to clean the shaker between different cocktails, this plan minimizes the number of steps by:

- Combining cocktails with the same ingredients.
- Reusing shot glasses when possible.
- Efficiently managing the grasping and leaving of containers to keep hands free when required.

---

**Conclusion:**

By following this sequence of actions, you can efficiently make all four cocktails as per the goal state, using the available resources and adhering strictly to all the action constraints. This plan is optimal under the given conditions.
