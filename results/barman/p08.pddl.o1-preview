To solve the problem of preparing four cocktails with the given constraints and resources, we need to carefully plan the sequence of actions while minimizing unnecessary steps. Here's an optimal plan that follows all the rules:

**Initial Setup:**
- You have 5 clean shot glasses: shot1, shot2, shot3, shot4, and shot5.
- You have 1 clean shaker on the table.
- Your left and right hands are empty.

---

### **Prepare Cocktail1 (Ingredient2 + Ingredient3) into Shot Glass 4**

**1.** **Grasp Shot Glass1 with Left Hand**
   - Left Hand: Holding Shot Glass1
   - Right Hand: Empty

**2.** **Fill Shot Glass1 with Ingredient2**
   - Requires: Holding Shot Glass1, Right Hand Empty, Shot Glass1 is empty and clean.

**3.** **Pour from Shot Glass1 to Shaker**
   - Requires: Holding Shot Glass1 with Ingredient2, Shaker is empty and clean on the table.
   - Result:
     - Shaker now contains Ingredient2 at level 1.
     - Shot Glass1 becomes empty (but not necessarily clean).

**4.** **Leave Shot Glass1 on the Table**
   - Left Hand: Empty

**5.** **Grasp Shot Glass2 with Left Hand**

**6.** **Fill Shot Glass2 with Ingredient3**
   - Requires: Holding Shot Glass2, Right Hand Empty, Shot Glass2 is empty and clean.

**7.** **Pour from Shot Glass2 to Shaker**
   - Requires: Holding Shot Glass2 with Ingredient3, Shaker is unshaken and not full (level 1).
   - Result:
     - Shaker now contains Ingredient2 and Ingredient3 at level 2.
     - Shot Glass2 becomes empty.

**8.** **Leave Shot Glass2 on the Table**
   - Left Hand: Empty

**9.** **Grasp Shaker with Left Hand**

**10.** **Shake the Shaker**
    - Requires: Holding the Shaker, Right Hand Empty, Shaker contains two ingredients needed for a cocktail.
    - Result:
      - Ingredients in the Shaker become Cocktail1.

**11.** **Pour from Shaker to Shot Glass4**
    - Requires: Holding the Shaker with Cocktail1, Shot Glass4 is empty and clean.
    - Result:
      - Shot Glass4 contains Cocktail1.
      - Shaker level decreases to level 1.

### **Prepare Cocktail3 (Ingredient3 + Ingredient2) into Shot Glass1**

**12.** **Empty the Shaker**
    - Requires: Holding the Shaker, Shaker contains a shaken beverage.
    - Result:
      - Shaker becomes empty.

**13.** **Clean the Shaker**
    - Requires: Holding the Shaker, Right Hand Empty, Shaker is empty.
    - Result:
      - Shaker becomes clean.

**14.** **Clean Shot Glass1**
    - Requires: Holding Shot Glass1, Right Hand Empty, Shot Glass1 is empty.
    - Result:
      - Shot Glass1 becomes clean.

**15.** **Grasp Shot Glass1 with Left Hand**

**16.** **Fill Shot Glass1 with Ingredient3**
    - Requires: Holding Shot Glass1, Right Hand Empty, Shot Glass1 is empty and clean.

**17.** **Pour from Shot Glass1 to Shaker**
    - Requires: Holding Shot Glass1 with Ingredient3, Shaker is empty and clean.
    - Result:
      - Shaker contains Ingredient3 at level 1.
      - Shot Glass1 becomes empty.

**18.** **Leave Shot Glass1 on the Table**

**19.** **Grasp Shot Glass2 with Left Hand**

**20.** **Fill Shot Glass2 with Ingredient2**
    - Requires: Holding Shot Glass2, Right Hand Empty, Shot Glass2 is empty (since it was emptied earlier and hasn't been cleaned yet) and has previously contained Ingredient2 (it hasn't), so we need to clean it first.

**21.** **Clean Shot Glass2**
    - Requires: Holding Shot Glass2, Right Hand Empty, Shot Glass2 is empty.
    - Result:
      - Shot Glass2 becomes clean.

**22.** **Fill Shot Glass2 with Ingredient2**

**23.** **Pour from Shot Glass2 to Shaker**
    - Requires: Holding Shot Glass2 with Ingredient2, Shaker is unshaken and not full.
    - Result:
      - Shaker now contains Ingredient3 and Ingredient2 at level 2.
      - Shot Glass2 becomes empty.

**24.** **Leave Shot Glass2 on the Table**

**25.** **Grasp Shaker with Left Hand**

**26.** **Shake the Shaker**
    - Result:
      - Ingredients in the Shaker become Cocktail3.

**27.** **Pour from Shaker to Shot Glass1**
    - Requires: Holding the Shaker with Cocktail3, Shot Glass1 is empty and clean (we cleaned it earlier).
    - Result:
      - Shot Glass1 contains Cocktail3.
      - Shaker level decreases.

### **Prepare Cocktail2 (Ingredient1 + Ingredient3) into Shot Glass2**

**28.** **Empty the Shaker**

**29.** **Clean the Shaker**

**30.** **Clean Shot Glass2**

**31.** **Grasp Shot Glass1 with Left Hand**

**32.** **Fill Shot Glass1 with Ingredient1**

**33.** **Pour from Shot Glass1 to Shaker**

**34.** **Leave Shot Glass1 on the Table**

**35.** **Grasp Shot Glass2 with Left Hand**

**36.** **Fill Shot Glass2 with Ingredient3**

**37.** **Pour from Shot Glass2 to Shaker**

**38.** **Leave Shot Glass2 on the Table**

**39.** **Grasp Shaker with Left Hand**

**40.** **Shake the Shaker**
    - Result:
      - Ingredients become Cocktail2.

**41.** **Pour from Shaker to Shot Glass2**
    - Requires: Shot Glass2 is empty and clean.
    - Result:
      - Shot Glass2 contains Cocktail2.
      - Shaker level decreases.

### **Prepare Cocktail4 (Ingredient2 + Ingredient1) into Shot Glass3**

**42.** **Empty the Shaker**

**43.** **Clean the Shaker**

**44.** **Clean Shot Glass1** (if necessary)

**45.** **Grasp Shot Glass1 with Left Hand**

**46.** **Fill Shot Glass1 with Ingredient2**

**47.** **Pour from Shot Glass1 to Shaker**

**48.** **Leave Shot Glass1 on the Table**

**49.** **Grasp Shot Glass2 with Left Hand**

**50.** **Fill Shot Glass2 with Ingredient1**

**51.** **Pour from Shot Glass2 to Shaker**

**52.** **Leave Shot Glass2 on the Table**

**53.** **Grasp Shaker with Left Hand**

**54.** **Shake the Shaker**
    - Result:
      - Ingredients become Cocktail4.

**55.** **Pour from Shaker to Shot Glass3**
    - Requires: Shot Glass3 is empty and clean.
    - Result:
      - Shot Glass3 contains Cocktail4.

---

**Final State:**
- **Shot Glass1** contains Cocktail3.
- **Shot Glass2** contains Cocktail2.
- **Shot Glass3** contains Cocktail4.
- **Shot Glass4** contains Cocktail1.
- **Shaker** is empty and clean.
- All other shot glasses are empty.
- Both hands are empty.

This plan efficiently utilizes the resources by reusing shot glasses when possible and cleaning them only when necessary. It also minimizes the number of actions by carefully sequencing steps to avoid unnecessary movements.

---

**Notes:**
- We clean the shaker and shot glasses only when required by the constraints.
- We refill shot glasses without cleaning if they previously contained the same ingredient.
- We handle cocktails individually due to the possibility that the order of ingredients matters.

By following this plan, we adhere to all the given constraints and efficiently achieve the goal of preparing the four desired cocktails.
