4. **Leave ShotGlass1 on the table** (RH becomes empty).
5. **Grasp ShotGlass2** with RH.
6. **Fill ShotGlass2 with Ingredient1**.
7. **Pour from ShotGlass2 to Shaker** (Shaker now has Ingredient2 and Ingredient1).
   - *After effect:* Shaker contains both ingredients, ShotGlass2 becomes empty but not clean.
8. **Leave ShotGlass2 on the table** (RH becomes empty).
9. **Grasp Shaker** with RH.
