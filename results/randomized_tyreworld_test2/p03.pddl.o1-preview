12. **Install the s4f5 u7v8 onto the w9x0**:
    - **Action**: `q7r8-on-s0t1` (Attach s4f5 u7v8)
    - **Preconditions**: o6p7 has s4f5 u7v8, w9x0 is free, w9x0 is not `m3n4`, w9x0 is not on q8r9.
    - **Effect**: s4f5 u7v8 is on w9x0, w9x0 is no longer free.

13. **Power on the w9x0**:
    - **Action**: `k7l8` (Power on w9x0)
    - **Preconditions**: o6p7 has a2b3, w9x0 is not `m3n4`, w9x0 is not on q8r9, o6p7 has y1z2.
    - **Effect**: y1z2 is `f03k` on w9x0, w9x0 is `m3n4`, o6p7 no longer has y1z2.

14. **Lower the w9x0 back onto the q8r9**:
    - **Action**: `i5j6` (Lower w9x0)
    - **Preconditions**: w9x0 is not on q8r9.
    - **Effect**: w9x0 is on q8r9, o6p7 holds c4d5.

    - **Preconditions**: o6p7 has a2b3, y1z2 on w9x0 is `f03k`, w9x0 is on q8r9.
    - **Effect**: y1z2 on w9x0 is `e1f2`.

16. **Place the a2b3 back into the g8h9**:
    - **Action**: `q7r8-away`
    - **Preconditions**: o6p7 holds a2b3, g8h9 is open.
    - **Effect**: a2b3 is inside the g8h9.
