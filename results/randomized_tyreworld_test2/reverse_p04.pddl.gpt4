To solve the given planning problem, we need to ensure that all conditions and goals are satisfied in the most efficient way possible. Here's a step-by-step plan based on the actions available and the initial state of the problem:

close action:

Precondition: container is open.
Effect: container becomes closed and no longer open.
Purpose: Changes the state of boot to closed, which is a required goal state.
remove-wheel action for each flat tyre on hub:

Precondition: hub is not on ground, wheel is on hub, hub is not fastened.
Effect: agent will have the removed wheel and hub will be free, meaning wheel is no longer on hub.
Purpose: Removes flat tyre from the hub.
put-on-wheel action for each intact tyre:

Precondition: agent has the wheel, hub is free, hub is not fastened, and hub is not on ground.
Effect: wheel will be on hub, hub will no longer be free, and agent will no longer have the wheel.
Purpose: Places intact tyre onto hub.
inflate action for each intact tyre:

Precondition: agent has a pump, wheel is not inflated, and wheel is intact.
Effect: After the action is executed, the wheel will be inflated.
Purpose: Ensures intact tyre on the hub are inflated.
jack-up action:

Purpose: Lifts hub off ground using a jack to allow modifications.
Effect: hub will no longer be on ground.
jack-down action:

Purpose: Lowers hub back to ground after modifications are made.
Effect: Places hub back onto ground.
Place wrench, jack, and pump back in boot:

This is to ensure that all items including the modified intact tyre are stored properly as per the goal.
This sequence should satisfy all conditions:

flat tyre is replaced with intact tyre on the hub.
intact tyre is inflated.
The nut remains tight on the hub.
The flat tyre, wrench, jack, and pump are stored in the boot.
The boot becomes closed.
This plan uses the available actions optimally while considering the preconditions and effects to achieve the desired final state of the system.
