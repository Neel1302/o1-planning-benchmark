To solve the problem, we need an optimal plan that replaces the `flat tyre` (old components) with the `intact tyre` (new components) on the `hub` (machines), ensures that the `intact tyre` are `inflated` (activated/configured), and returns the tools and old components to the `boot` (storage container), which should be closed at the end. The `nut` (covers) should remain `tight` (secured/unlocked) on the `hub`.

Here is the optimal plan:

1. **Open the Storage Container**:
   - **Action**: `open` (Open `boot`)
   - **Preconditions**: `boot` is `unlocked` (unlocked) and `closed` (closed)
   - **Effects**: `boot` becomes `open` (open) and not `closed`

2. **Retrieve Tools from `boot`**:
   - **Action**: `fetch` (Retrieve items)
   - **Items to Retrieve**: `wrench` (tool), `jack` (lifting device), and `pump` (tool)
   - **Preconditions**: Each item is inside `boot`, which is `open` (open)
   - **Effects**: Agent `agent` holds each item after retrieval

3. **For Each `hub` (Repeat Steps 3a to 3k for each machine)**:

   a. **Lock the Cover on `hub`**:
      - **Action**: `loosen` (Lock `nut`)
      - **Preconditions**: `agent` has `wrench`, `nut` on `hub` is `tight`, `hub` is on `ground` (ground)
      - **Effects**: `nut` on `hub` becomes `loose` (locked)

   b. **Lift the `hub` Off the Ground**:
      - **Action**: `jack-up` (Lift `hub` using `jack`)
      - **Preconditions**: `agent` holds `jack`, `hub` is on `ground`
      - **Effects**: `hub` is not on `ground`, `agent` no longer holds `jack`

   c. **Remove the Cover from `hub`**:
      - **Action**: `undo` (Remove `nut`)
      - **Preconditions**: `hub` is not on `ground`, `hub` is `fastened` (covered), `agent` has `wrench`, `nut` is `loose`
      - **Effects**: `agent` holds `nut`, `hub` becomes not `fastened`

   d. **Remove the Old Component from `hub`**:
      - **Action**: `remove-wheel` (Remove `flat tyre`)
      - **Preconditions**: `hub` is not on `ground`, `flat tyre` is on `hub`, `hub` is not `fastened`
      - **Effects**: `agent` holds `flat tyre`, `hub` becomes free (no component)

   e. **Place the Old Component into `boot`**:
      - **Action**: `put-away` (Store `flat tyre` in `boot`)
      - **Preconditions**: `agent` holds `flat tyre`, `boot` is `open` (open)
      - **Effects**: `flat tyre` is inside `boot`, `agent` no longer holds `flat tyre`

   f. **Retrieve the New Component from `boot`**:
      - **Action**: `fetch` (Retrieve `intact tyre`)
      - **Preconditions**: `intact tyre` is inside `boot`, which is `open` (open)
      - **Effects**: `agent` holds `intact tyre`

   g. **Install the New Component onto `hub`**:
      - **Action**: `put-on-wheel` (Install `intact tyre`)
      - **Preconditions**: `agent` has `intact tyre`, `hub` is free, `hub` is not `fastened`, `hub` is not on `ground`
      - **Effects**: `intact tyre` is on `hub`, `hub` becomes not free, `agent` no longer holds `intact tyre`

   h. **Activate/Configure the New Component**:
      - **Action**: `inflate` (Configure `intact tyre` using `pump`)
      - **Preconditions**: `agent` has `pump`, `intact tyre` is not `inflated`, `intact tyre` is on `hub`
      - **Effects**: `intact tyre` becomes `inflated`

   i. **Reattach the Cover onto `hub`**:
      - **Action**: `do-up` (Attach `nut`)
      - **Preconditions**: `agent` has `wrench`, `hub` is not `fastened`, `hub` is not on `ground`, `agent` has `nut` to be `fastened`
      - **Effects**: `nut` is `loose` on `hub`, `hub` becomes `fastened`, `agent` no longer holds `nut`

   j. **Lower the `hub` Back to the Ground**:
      - **Action**: `jack-down` (Lower `hub`)
      - **Preconditions**: `agent` holds `hub` off `ground`
      - **Effects**: `hub` is on `ground`, `agent` holds `jack`

   k. **Unlock the Cover on `hub`**:
      - **Action**: `tighten` (Unlock `nut`)
      - **Preconditions**: `agent` has `wrench`, `nut` on `hub` is `loose`, `hub` is on `ground`
      - **Effects**: `nut` on `hub` becomes `tight`

4. **Return Tools to `boot`**:
   - **Action**: `put-away` (Store items in `boot`)
   - **Items to Return**: `jack`, `pump`, `wrench`
   - **Preconditions**: Each item is held by `agent`, `boot` is `open` (open)
   - **Effects**: Each item is inside `boot`, `agent` no longer holds the items

5. **Close the Storage Container**:
   - **Action**: `close` (Close `boot`)
   - **Preconditions**: `boot` is `open` (open)
   - **Effects**: `boot` becomes `closed` (closed) and not `open`

This plan ensures that:
- All `flat tyre` (old components), `wrench`, `jack`, and `pump` are stored in the `boot` at the end.
- The `intact tyre` (new components) are installed and `inflated` (configured) on the `hub`.
- The `nut` (covers) are `tight` (secured/unlocked) on the `hub`.
- The `boot` is closed at the end.

By following this sequence of actions, the goal state is achieved efficiently, adhering to all the preconditions and effects defined in the domain.
