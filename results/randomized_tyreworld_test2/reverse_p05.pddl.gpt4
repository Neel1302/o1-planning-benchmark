To achieve the goals set out in the planning problem you described, we can develop an optimal sequence of actions. Here's the step-by-step plan using the provided actions and meeting the goal requirements:

### Initial Setup:
- **`boot` is `closed`.**
- **`flat tyre` are on the `hub` which are on the `ground`.**
- **`intact tyre` are in `boot` and not `inflated`.**
- **`nut` are `tight` on `hub`.**
- **`hub` are `fastened`.**

### Goals:
- **Replace `flat tyre` with `intact tyre` on `hub`.**
- **Make `intact tyre` `inflated`.**
- **Ensure `nut` remain `tight` on `hub`.**
- **Move `flat tyre`, `wrench`, `jack`, and `pump` to `boot`.**
- **`boot` should remain `closed`.**

### Plan:

1. **Use `remove-wheel` for each `flat tyre` on `hub`:**
   - This action removes each `flat tyre` from `hub`.
   - It makes `hub` free of `flat tyre`.

2. **Use `put-on-wheel` for each `intact tyre`:**
   - This action places each `intact tyre` onto the now free `hub`.
   - `hub` will no longer be free, and `intact tyre` are on `hub`.

3. **Use `inflate` for each `intact tyre` on `hub`:**
   - This action `inflates` each `intact tyre`, making them `inflated`.
   - Ensures `intact tyre` on `hub` are `inflated`.

4. **`loosen` and `tighten` to manage `nut` state (if needed):**
   - If any `nut` changes from `tight`, use these actions to revert or ensure it stays `tight`.

5. **Move `flat tyre`, `wrench`, `jack`, and `pump` back into `boot`:**
   - Physically move these items into `boot` to ensure all specified elements are inside.
   - Since they are simply being moved, specific actions from the list aren't necessary unless detailed in constraints.

### Considerations:
- All actions should adhere to the conditions given for each. If any action cannot be performed due to precondition failures, additional steps may be needed to modify the environment or the states of objects.
- The plan assumes that moving items back into `boot` does not require a specific action from the list unless otherwise specified.
- Monitor and ensure that the `boot` remains `closed` throughout the operations.

This sequence should meet all the goal conditions specified in the problem setup.
