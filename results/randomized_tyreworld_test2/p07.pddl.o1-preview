To achieve the goal of replacing the **s5t6 u7v8** with **s4f5 u7v8** on the **w9x0**, ensuring the **s4f5 u7v8** are **s9t0d**, and meeting all other specified conditions, the following optimal plan can be executed:

### Initial Preparation:

1. **Ensure possession of necessary tools and items:**
   - **e5f6** (have) the **c4d5** (tool required for lifting), **e6f7** (tool required for **s9t0** action), and **a2b3** (additional tool).
   - **Note:** These items are already in the **g8h9** (as per the initial state).

### For Each of the 7 **w9x0**:

Repeat the following steps for each **w9x0** (unit to be serviced):

1. **Retrieve the **c4d5**:**
   - Go to the **g8h9** (storage area).
   - **e5f6** (pick up) the **c4d5**.

2. **Lift the **w9x0** off the **q8r9**:**
   - **Action:** **g3h4**
     - **Preconditions:**
       - **o6p7** (you) **e5f6** the **c4d5**.
       - The **w9x0** is on the **q8r9** (initial position).
     - **Effect:**
       - The **w9x0** is no longer on the **q8r9** (it is elevated).
       - **o6p7** no longer **e5f6** the **c4d5** (the tool is used in lifting).

3. **Remove the **s5t6 u7v8** from the **w9x0**:**
   - **Action:** **o5p6-s0t1**
     - **Preconditions:**
       - The **w9x0** is not on the **q8r9** (it is lifted).
       - The **s0t1** (**s5t6 u7v8**) is on the **w9x0**.
       - The **w9x0** is not **m3n4** (in a certain state that prevents removal).
     - **Effect:**
       - **o6p7** **e5f6** the **s5t6 u7v8** (you are now holding the old item).
       - The **w9x0** is free (the old item is removed).

4. **Place the **s5t6 u7v8** in the **g8h9**:**
   - Take the **s5t6 u7v8** back to the **g8h9** and place it there.

5. **Retrieve a **s4f5 u7v8** from the **g8h9**:**
   - **e5f6** the **s4f5 u7v8** (pick up a new item).
   - **Note:** The **s4f5 u7v8** are in the **g8h9** and are not **s9t0d**.

6. **Perform the **s9t0** action on the **s4f5 u7v8**:**
   - **Action:** **s9t0**
     - **Preconditions:**
       - **o6p7** **e5f6** the **e6f7** (you have the tool needed for this action).
       - The **s0t1** (**s4f5 u7v8**) is not **s9t0d**.
       - The **s0t1** is **s4f5** (it is the correct type).
     - **Effect:**
       - The **s4f5 u7v8** is now **s9t0d**.

7. **Install the **s4f5 u7v8** onto the **w9x0**:**
   - **Action:** **q7r8-on-s0t1**
     - **Preconditions:**
       - **o6p7** **e5f6** the **s4f5 u7v8**.
       - The **w9x0** is free (ready for installation).
       - The **w9x0** is not **m3n4**.
       - The **w9x0** is not on the **q8r9** (it is still elevated).
     - **Effect:**
       - The **s4f5 u7v8** is now on the **w9x0**.
       - The **w9x0** is no longer free.
       - **o6p7** no longer **e5f6** the **s4f5 u7v8**.

8. **Lower the **w9x0** back onto the **q8r9**:**
   - **Action:** **i5j6**
     - **Preconditions:**
       - The **w9x0** is not on the **q8r9** (it is elevated).
       - **o6p7** has lifted the **w9x0** using the **c4d5**.
     - **Effect:**
       - The **w9x0** is back on the **q8r9**.
       - **o6p7** **e5f6** the **c4d5** (you have the tool again).

9. **Return the **c4d5** to the **g8h9**:**
   - Place the **c4d5** back in the **g8h9** for future use.

### Final Steps:

1. **Ensure all items are in their proper places:**
   - **s5t6 u7v8**, **a2b3**, **c4d5**, and **e6f7** are in the **g8h9**.

2. **Confirm the **y1z2** are **e1f2** on the **w9x0**:**
   - This condition remains satisfied throughout the process.

3. **Verify the **g8h9** is **w3x4d**:**
   - Since the **g8h9** started **w3x4d** and was never **u1v2** (locked), it remains **w3x4d**.

### Summary of Actions:

- **For Each **w9x0**:**
  1. **g3h4**: Lift the **w9x0** off the **q8r9** using the **c4d5**.
  2. **o5p6-s0t1**: Remove the **s5t6 u7v8** from the **w9x0**.
  3. **s9t0**: Prepare the **s4f5 u7v8** using the **e6f7**.
  4. **q7r8-on-s0t1**: Install the **s4f5 u7v8** onto the **w9x0**.
  5. **i5j6**: Lower the **w9x0** back onto the **q8r9** using the **c4d5**.
  6. Return tools and items to the **g8h9**.

By following this plan, all goals are achieved optimally:

- **s5t6 u7v8** are replaced with **s4f5 u7v8** on each **w9x0**.
- **s4f5 u7v8** are **s9t0d**.
- **y1z2** remain **e1f2** on the **w9x0**.
- Tools and removed items are stored in the **g8h9**.
- The **g8h9** remains **w3x4d**.

This sequence of actions ensures efficiency by minimizing unnecessary steps and consolidating tasks where possible.
