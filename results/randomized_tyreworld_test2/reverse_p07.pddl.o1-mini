Certainly! Here's an **optimal plan** to achieve your goal, presented as a sequence of actions:

1. **`loosen`**
   - **Purpose:** Change `nut` on `hub` from `tight` to `loose`.
   - **Preconditions Met:** 
     - `agent` has `wrench`.
     - `nut` on `hub` is `tight`.
     - `hub` is on `ground`.
   
2. **`jack-up`**
   - **Purpose:** Lift `hub` off `ground` using `jack`.
   - **Preconditions Met:**
     - `agent` is executing `have` on `jack`.
     - `hub` is on `ground`.

3. **`undo`**
   - **Purpose:** Change the state of `hub` from `fastened` to not `fastened`.
   - **Preconditions Met:**
     - `hub` is not on `ground`.
     - `hub` is `fastened`.
     - `agent` has `wrench`.
     - `nut` on `hub` is `loose`.

4. **`remove-wheel`**
   - **Purpose:** Remove `flat tyre` from `hub`.
   - **Preconditions Met:**
     - `hub` is not on `ground`.
     - `flat tyre` is on `hub`.
     - `hub` is not `fastened`.

5. **`jack-down`**
   - **Purpose:** Lower `hub` back to `ground` using `jack`.
   - **Preconditions Met:**
     - `agent` is executing `have` on `hub` off `ground`.

6. **`tighten`**
   - **Purpose:** Change `nut` on `hub` back from `loose` to `tight`.
   - **Preconditions Met:**
     - `agent` has `wrench`.
     - `nut` on `hub` is `loose`.
     - `hub` is on `ground`.

7. **`put-on-wheel`**
   - **Purpose:** Place `intact tyre` onto `hub`.
   - **Preconditions Met:**
     - `agent` has `intact tyre`.
     - `hub` is free.
     - `hub` is not `fastened`.
     - `hub` is not on `ground`.

8. **`inflate`**
   - **Purpose:** Change `intact tyre` to `inflated`.
   - **Preconditions Met:**
     - `agent` has `pump`.
     - `intact tyre` is `intact` and not `inflated`.

### **Summary of the Plan:**

1. **`loosen`**  
   Change `nut` from `tight` to `loose` on `hub`.

2. **`jack-up`**  
   Lift `hub` off `ground`.

3. **`undo`**  
   Update `hub` to no longer be `fastened`.

4. **`remove-wheel`**  
   Remove `flat tyre` from `hub`.

5. **`jack-down`**  
   Lower `hub` back onto `ground`.

6. **`tighten`**  
   Revert `nut` back to `tight` on `hub`.

7. **`put-on-wheel`**  
   Place `intact tyre` onto `hub`.

8. **`inflate`**  
   Change `intact tyre` to `inflated`.

This sequence ensures that all **preconditions** for each action are met before execution and that the **goal state** is achieved efficiently.
