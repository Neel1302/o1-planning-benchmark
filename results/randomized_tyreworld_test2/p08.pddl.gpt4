To solve the planning problem as described, we need to create a sequence of actions that achieves the stated goals within the given constraints and initial conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to plan the solution:

### Initial State:
- **s5t6 u7v8** are on the **w9x0**.
- **s4f5 u7v8** are in the **g8h9** and are not **s9t0d**.
- The **g8h9** is **w3x4d**.
- The **y1z2** are **e1f2** on the **w9x0**.
- The **w9x0** are on the **q8r9** and are **m3n4**.
- Objects **c4d5**, **e6f7**, and **a2b3** are also in the **g8h9**.

### Goals:
- Replace **s5t6 u7v8** with **s4f5 u7v8** on the **w9x0**.
- **s4f5 u7v8** should be **s9t0d**.
- The **y1z2** should remain **e1f2** on the **w9x0**.
- All items (**s5t6 u7v8**, **a2b3**, **c4d5**, **e6f7**) should end up in the **g8h9**.
- The **g8h9** should be **w3x4d**.

### Steps to Achieve Goals:

1. **"o5p6-s0t1" action**:
   - Remove **s5t6 u7v8** from **w9x0** since **s5t6 u7v8** is currently on the **w9x0** and it needs to be replaced. This action clears **s5t6 u7v8** from the **w9x0**.

2. **"q7r8-on-s0t1" action**:
   - Place **s4f5 u7v8** from the **g8h9** onto the **w9x0**. This action puts **s4f5 u7v8** in position to be **s9t0d**.

3. **"s9t0" action**:
   - **s9t0** the **s4f5 u7v8** using **e6f7**. This action changes the state of **s4f5 u7v8** to be **s9t0d**, fulfilling one of the goal conditions.

4. **"u1v2" action**:
   - Given the precondition that the **k2l3** is **930d** and **w3x4d**, perform action to change the state of **k2l3** to **u1v2** and not **w3x4d**. This step may be required if **g8h9**'s **w3x4d** state needs adjusting based on other intermediate states not described.

5. **"w3x4" action**:
   - If **k2l3** was changed to **u1v2**, revert it to **w3x4d** to maintain or restore the **g8h9** state to **w3x4d**.

6. Gather all items (**s5t6 u7v8**, **a2b3**, **c4d5**, **e6f7**) back into the **g8h9**. This step involves physically moving these items back to the **g8h9**, although specific actions are not detailed in the list provided.

By executing these steps in sequence, the plan satisfies all conditions and goals described in the problem. This assumes all actions can be initiated based on their preconditions being met at the time of execution.
