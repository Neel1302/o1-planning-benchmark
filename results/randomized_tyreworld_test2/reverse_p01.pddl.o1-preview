To solve this planning problem optimally, we need to perform a series of actions that transform the initial state into the goal state, ensuring all preconditions of the actions are met. Below is the optimal plan:

1. **Unlock the Garage** (`open` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The garage door (`container`) is closed (`unlocked`) and locked (`closed`).
   - *Effect*: The garage door is unlocked (`open`) and no longer locked.

2. **Take the Jack from the Garage** (`fetch` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The jack (`jack`) is inside the garage (`container`), and the garage door is unlocked (`open`).
   - *Effect*: You (`agent`) have the jack, and it is no longer inside the garage.

3. **Take the Torque Wrench from the Garage** (`fetch` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The torque wrench (`pump`) is inside the garage, and the garage door is unlocked.
   - *Effect*: You have the torque wrench, and it is no longer inside the garage.

4. **Take the wrench Tool from the Garage** (`fetch` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The tool (`wrench`) is inside the garage, and the garage door is unlocked.
   - *Effect*: You have the tool, and it is no longer inside the garage.

5. **Take the New Tires from the Garage** (`fetch` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The new tires (`intact tyre`) are inside the garage, and the garage door is unlocked.
   - *Effect*: You have the new tires, and they are no longer inside the garage.

6. **Lift the Vehicle Off the Ground** (`jack-up` action)
   - *Preconditions*: You have the jack (`jack`), and the vehicle (`hub`) is on the ground (`ground`).
   - *Effect*: The vehicle is off the ground, and you no longer have the jack.

7. **Remove the nut (Brake) from the Vehicle** (`undo` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The vehicle is off the ground, is braked (`fastened`), you have the `wrench` tool, and the nut is set to `loose`.
   - *Effect*: You have the nut, the vehicle is not braked, nut is no longer set to `loose`, and the vehicle is not braked anymore.

8. **Remove the Old Tires from the Vehicle** (`remove-wheel` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The vehicle is off the ground, the old tires (`flat tyre`) are on the vehicle, and the vehicle is not braked.
   - *Effect*: You have the old tires, and they are no longer on the vehicle.

9. **Install the New Tires onto the Vehicle** (`put-on-wheel` action)
   - *Preconditions*: You have the new tires, the vehicle is free (no tires on it), the vehicle is not braked, and it is off the ground.
   - *Effect*: The new tires are on the vehicle, the vehicle is no longer free, and you no longer have the new tires.

10. **Tighten the New Tires** (`inflate` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the torque wrench (`pump`), the new tires are not tightened (`inflated`), and the new tires are installed (`intact`).
    - *Effect*: The new tires are tightened (`inflated`).

11. **Reinstall the nut (Brake) onto the Vehicle** (`do-up` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the `wrench` tool, the vehicle is not braked, the vehicle is off the ground, and you have the nut to be braked.
    - *Effect*: The nut is now set to `loose` on the vehicle, the vehicle is braked, and you no longer have the nut.

12. **Lower the Vehicle Back to the Ground** (`jack-down` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You are lifting the vehicle off the ground.
    - *Effect*: The vehicle is back on the ground, and you have the jack again.

13. **Release the nut (Brake) on the Vehicle** (`tighten` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the `wrench` tool, the nut on the vehicle is set to `loose`, and the vehicle is on the ground.
    - *Effect*: The nut on the vehicle is set to `tight` (released).

14. **Return the Jack to the Garage** (`put-away` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the jack, and the garage door is unlocked.
    - *Effect*: The jack is inside the garage, and you no longer have it.

15. **Return the Torque Wrench to the Garage** (`put-away` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the torque wrench, and the garage door is unlocked.
    - *Effect*: The torque wrench is inside the garage, and you no longer have it.

16. **Return the Old Tires to the Garage** (`put-away` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the old tires, and the garage door is unlocked.
    - *Effect*: The old tires are inside the garage, and you no longer have them.

17. **Return the wrench Tool to the Garage** (`put-away` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the `wrench` tool, and the garage door is unlocked.
    - *Effect*: The tool is inside the garage, and you no longer have it.

18. **Lock the Garage** (`close` action)
    - *Preconditions*: The garage door is unlocked (`open`).
    - *Effect*: The garage door is locked (`closed`) and no longer unlocked.

This plan ensures that:
- The old tires (`flat tyre`) are replaced with the new tires (`intact tyre`) on the vehicle (`hub`).
- The new tires are tightened (`inflated`).
- The nut (brake) is set to `tight` (released) on the vehicle.
- The old tires, `wrench` tool, jack (`jack`), and torque wrench (`pump`) are returned to the garage (`boot`).
- The garage is locked (`closed`).

This sequence of actions is optimal, as it accomplishes the goals with the minimal necessary steps while respecting all action preconditions and effects.
