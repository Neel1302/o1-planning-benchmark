To achieve your goal of replacing **s5t6 u7v8** with **s4f5 u7v8** on the **w9x0** and ensuring all other conditions are met, the following optimal sequence of actions should be executed:

1. **c9d0**
2. **g3h4**
3. **k1l2**
4. **o5p6-s0t1**
5. **q7r8-on-s0t1**
6. **s9t0**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **c9d0**
   - **Purpose:** Change the state of **y1z2** on **w9x0** from **e1f2** to **f03k**.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - **o6p7** has **a2b3**.
     - **y1z2** on **w9x0** is **e1f2**.
     - **w9x0** is on **q8r9**.
   - **Effects:**
     - **y1z2** on **w9x0** becomes **f03k**.
     - **e1f2** is no longer present on **w9x0**.

2. **g3h4**
   - **Purpose:** Lift **w9x0** off **q8r9** using **c4d5**.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - **o6p7** is executing (**e5f6**) a **c4d5**.
     - **w9x0** is on **q8r9**.
   - **Effects:**
     - **w9x0** is no longer on **q8r9**.
     - **o6p7** stops executing (**e5f6**) the **c4d5**.

3. **k1l2**
   - **Purpose:** Update the state of **w9x0** to no longer be **m3n4** and manage **y1z2**.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - **w9x0** is not on **q8r9** (achieved by **g3h4**).
     - **w9x0** is **m3n4**.
     - **o6p7** has **a2b3**.
     - **y1z2** is **f03k** on **w9x0** (achieved by **c9d0**).
   - **Effects:**
     - **o6p7** now has **y1z2**.
     - **w9x0** is no longer **m3n4**.
     - **f03k** is removed from **w9x0**.

4. **o5p6-s0t1**
   - **Purpose:** Remove **s5t6 u7v8** from **w9x0**.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - **w9x0** is not on **q8r9** (achieved by **g3h4**).
     - **s0t1** (**s5t6 u7v8**) is currently on **w9x0**.
     - **w9x0** is not **m3n4** (achieved by **k1l2**).
   - **Effects:**
     - **o6p7** stops executing (**e5f6**) the **o5p6d s0t1**.
     - **w9x0** becomes free (i.e., **s0t1** is no longer on **w9x0**).

5. **q7r8-on-s0t1**
   - **Purpose:** Place **s4f5 u7v8** onto **w9x0**.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - **o6p7** has **s0t1** (**s4f5 u7v8**).
     - **w9x0** is free.
     - **w9x0** is not **m3n4** (maintained by **k1l2**).
     - **w9x0** is not on **q8r9** (maintained by **g3h4**).
   - **Effects:**
     - **s0t1** (**s4f5 u7v8**) is now on **w9x0**.
     - **w9x0** is no longer free.
     - **o6p7** stops executing (**e5f6**) **s0t1**.

6. **s9t0**
   - **Purpose:** Change the state of **s4f5 u7v8** to **s9t0d**.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - **o6p7** has **e6f7**.
     - **s0t1** (**s4f5 u7v8**) is not **s9t0d**.
     - **s0t1** is **s4f5**.
   - **Effects:**
     - **s0t1** (**s4f5 u7v8**) becomes **s9t0d**.

### Final State Achieved:

- **s4f5 u7v8** has been successfully replaced by **s9t0d** on **w9x0**.
- **y1z2** remains as **e1f2** on **w9x0**.
- **s5t6 u7v8**, **a2b3**, **c4d5**, and **e6f7** are all within **g8h9**.
- **g8h9** remains in the **w3x4d** state.

This sequence ensures that all preconditions are met before each action and that the final state aligns perfectly with your specified goals.
