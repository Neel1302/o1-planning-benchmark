   - **Effect**: intact tyre is inflated.

8. **Lift the hub off the ground using the jack**:
   - **Action**: `jack-up` (Lift hub)
   - **Preconditions**: agent holds jack, hub is on ground.
   - **Effect**: hub is not on ground, agent no longer holds jack.

9. **Power off the hub**:

   - **Preconditions**: hub is not on ground, hub is `fastened`, agent has wrench, nut on hub is `loose`.
   - **Effect**: agent has nut, hub is not `fastened`.

10. **Remove the flat tyre from the hub**:
    - **Action**: `remove-wheel` (Remove flat tyre)
    - **Preconditions**: hub is not on ground, flat tyre is on hub, hub is not `fastened`.
    - **Effect**: agent holds flat tyre, hub is free.

11. **Place the flat tyre into the boot**:
    - **Action**: `put-away` (Put item into container)
    - **Preconditions**: agent holds flat tyre, boot is open.
    - **Effect**: flat tyre is inside the boot, agent no longer holds it.

12. **Install the intact tyre onto the hub**:
    - **Action**: `put-on-wheel` (Attach intact tyre)
    - **Preconditions**: agent has intact tyre, hub is free, hub is not `fastened`, hub is not on ground.
    - **Effect**: intact tyre is on hub, hub is no longer free.

13. **Power on the hub**:
    - **Action**: `do-up` (Power on hub)
    - **Preconditions**: agent has wrench, hub is not `fastened`, hub is not on ground, agent has nut.
    - **Effect**: nut is `loose` on hub, hub is `fastened`, agent no longer has nut.

14. **Lower the hub back onto the ground**:
    - **Action**: `jack-down` (Lower hub)
    - **Preconditions**: hub is not on ground.
    - **Effect**: hub is on ground, agent holds jack.

15. **Change the nut on the hub back to tight**:
    - **Action**: `tighten`
    - **Preconditions**: agent has wrench, nut on hub is `loose`, hub is on ground.
    - **Effect**: nut on hub is `tight`.

16. **Place the wrench back into the boot**:
    - **Action**: `put-away`
    - **Preconditions**: agent holds wrench, boot is open.
    - **Effect**: wrench is inside the boot.

17. **Place the jack back into the boot**:
    - **Action**: `put-away`
    - **Preconditions**: agent holds jack.
    - **Effect**: jack is inside the boot.

18. **Place the pump back into the boot**:
    - **Action**: `put-away`

    - **Effect**: pump is inside the boot.

19. **Close the boot**:
    - **Action**: `close` (Close container)
    - **Preconditions**: boot is open.
    - **Effect**: boot is closed (`closed`) and not open.

This plan ensures that:
- The flat tyre, wrench, jack, and pump are back inside the boot.
- The boot is closed.
- The intact tyre are inflated and installed on the hub.
- The nut are `tight` on the hub.
- The hub are on the ground and powered on (`fastened`).

This sequence of actions fulfills all the goal conditions optimally, using the provided action definitions.
