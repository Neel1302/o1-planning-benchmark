     - `s5t6 u7v8` is no longer on `w9x0`.
     - `s5t6 u7v8` is now in `g8h9`.

5. **`q7r8-on-s0t1` Action**
   - **Purpose:** Place `s4f5 u7v8` onto `w9x0`.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `o6p7` has the `s0t1` (which is `s4f5 u7v8`).
     - `w9x0` is free.
     - `w9x0` is not `m3n4`.
     - `w9x0` is not on `q8r9`.
   - **Effect:** 
     - `s4f5 u7v8` is now on `w9x0`.
     - `w9x0` is no longer free.
     - `o6p7` no longer holds the `s0t1`.

6. **`s9t0` Action**
   - **Purpose:** Change `s4f5 u7v8` to `s9t0d`.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `o6p7` has an `e6f7`.
     - `s4f5 u7v8` is not already `s9t0d`.
     - `s4f5 u7v8` is in the state `s4f5`.
   - **Effect:** 
     - `s4f5 u7v8` becomes `s9t0d`.

7. **`i5j6` Action**
   - **Purpose:** Lower the `w9x0` back onto the `q8r9` using a `c4d5`.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `o6p7` is actively using the `w9x0` off the `q8r9`.
   - **Effect:** 
     - `w9x0` is back on `q8r9`.
     - `o6p7` resumes using the `c4d5`.

8. **`f8k1` Action**
   - **Purpose:** Reset `y1z2` on `w9x0` back to `e1f2`.
   - **Preconditions:**
     - `o6p7` has a `a2b3`.
     - `y1z2` on `w9x0` is currently `f03k`.
     - `w9x0` is on `q8r9`.
   - **Effect:** 
     - `y1z2` on `w9x0` becomes `e1f2`.
     - `f03k` is no longer present.

### **Summary of the Plan:**

1. **`c9d0`**
2. **`g3h4`**
3. **`k1l2`**
4. **`o5p6-s0t1`**
5. **`q7r8-on-s0t1`**
6. **`s9t0`**
7. **`i5j6`**
8. **`f8k1`**

### **Explanation:**

- **Steps 1-3:** Prepare the `w9x0` by updating `y1z2`, lifting it off `q8r9`, and removing the `m3n4` status to satisfy the preconditions for removing `s5t6 u7v8`.
  
- **Step 4:** Remove `s5t6 u7v8` from `w9x0` and place it into `g8h9`.

- **Steps 5-6:** Place `s4f5 u7v8` onto `w9x0` and change its state to `s9t0d` as required.

- **Steps 7-8:** Lower the `w9x0` back onto `q8r9` and reset `y1z2` to its original state `e1f2` to fully satisfy the goal conditions.

This sequence ensures that all preconditions for each action are met before execution and that the final state aligns perfectly with your specified goals.
