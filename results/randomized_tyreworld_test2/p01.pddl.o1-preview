To solve this planning problem optimally, we need to perform a series of actions that transform the initial state into the goal state, ensuring all preconditions of the actions are met. Below is the optimal plan:

1. **Unlock the Garage** (`u1v2` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The garage door (`k2l3`) is closed (`930d`) and locked (`w3x4d`).
   - *Effect*: The garage door is unlocked (`u1v2`) and no longer locked.

2. **Take the Jack from the Garage** (`y5z6` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The jack (`c4d5`) is inside the garage (`k2l3`), and the garage door is unlocked (`u1v2`).
   - *Effect*: You (`o6p7`) have the jack, and it is no longer inside the garage.

3. **Take the Torque Wrench from the Garage** (`y5z6` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The torque wrench (`e6f7`) is inside the garage, and the garage door is unlocked.
   - *Effect*: You have the torque wrench, and it is no longer inside the garage.

4. **Take the A2B3 Tool from the Garage** (`y5z6` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The tool (`a2b3`) is inside the garage, and the garage door is unlocked.
   - *Effect*: You have the tool, and it is no longer inside the garage.

5. **Take the New Tires from the Garage** (`y5z6` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The new tires (`s4f5 u7v8`) are inside the garage, and the garage door is unlocked.
   - *Effect*: You have the new tires, and they are no longer inside the garage.

6. **Lift the Vehicle Off the Ground** (`g3h4` action)
   - *Preconditions*: You have the jack (`c4d5`), and the vehicle (`w9x0`) is on the ground (`q8r9`).
   - *Effect*: The vehicle is off the ground, and you no longer have the jack.

7. **Remove the Y1Z2 (Brake) from the Vehicle** (`k1l2` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The vehicle is off the ground, is braked (`m3n4`), you have the `a2b3` tool, and the y1z2 is set to `f03k`.
   - *Effect*: You have the y1z2, the vehicle is not braked, y1z2 is no longer set to `f03k`, and the vehicle is not braked anymore.

8. **Remove the Old Tires from the Vehicle** (`o5p6-s0t1` action)
   - *Preconditions*: The vehicle is off the ground, the old tires (`s5t6 u7v8`) are on the vehicle, and the vehicle is not braked.
   - *Effect*: You have the old tires, and they are no longer on the vehicle.

9. **Install the New Tires onto the Vehicle** (`q7r8-on-s0t1` action)
   - *Preconditions*: You have the new tires, the vehicle is free (no tires on it), the vehicle is not braked, and it is off the ground.
   - *Effect*: The new tires are on the vehicle, the vehicle is no longer free, and you no longer have the new tires.

10. **Tighten the New Tires** (`s9t0` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the torque wrench (`e6f7`), the new tires are not tightened (`s9t0d`), and the new tires are installed (`s4f5`).
    - *Effect*: The new tires are tightened (`s9t0d`).

11. **Reinstall the Y1Z2 (Brake) onto the Vehicle** (`k7l8` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the `a2b3` tool, the vehicle is not braked, the vehicle is off the ground, and you have the y1z2 to be braked.
    - *Effect*: The y1z2 is now set to `f03k` on the vehicle, the vehicle is braked, and you no longer have the y1z2.

12. **Lower the Vehicle Back to the Ground** (`i5j6` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You are lifting the vehicle off the ground.
    - *Effect*: The vehicle is back on the ground, and you have the jack again.

13. **Release the Y1Z2 (Brake) on the Vehicle** (`f8k1` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the `a2b3` tool, the y1z2 on the vehicle is set to `f03k`, and the vehicle is on the ground.
    - *Effect*: The y1z2 on the vehicle is set to `e1f2` (released).

14. **Return the Jack to the Garage** (`q7r8-away` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the jack, and the garage door is unlocked.
    - *Effect*: The jack is inside the garage, and you no longer have it.

15. **Return the Torque Wrench to the Garage** (`q7r8-away` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the torque wrench, and the garage door is unlocked.
    - *Effect*: The torque wrench is inside the garage, and you no longer have it.

16. **Return the Old Tires to the Garage** (`q7r8-away` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the old tires, and the garage door is unlocked.
    - *Effect*: The old tires are inside the garage, and you no longer have them.

17. **Return the A2B3 Tool to the Garage** (`q7r8-away` action)
    - *Preconditions*: You have the `a2b3` tool, and the garage door is unlocked.
    - *Effect*: The tool is inside the garage, and you no longer have it.

18. **Lock the Garage** (`w3x4` action)
    - *Preconditions*: The garage door is unlocked (`u1v2`).
    - *Effect*: The garage door is locked (`w3x4d`) and no longer unlocked.

This plan ensures that:
- The old tires (`s5t6 u7v8`) are replaced with the new tires (`s4f5 u7v8`) on the vehicle (`w9x0`).
- The new tires are tightened (`s9t0d`).
- The y1z2 (brake) is set to `e1f2` (released) on the vehicle.
- The old tires, `a2b3` tool, jack (`c4d5`), and torque wrench (`e6f7`) are returned to the garage (`g8h9`).
- The garage is locked (`w3x4d`).

This sequence of actions is optimal, as it accomplishes the goals with the minimal necessary steps while respecting all action preconditions and effects.
