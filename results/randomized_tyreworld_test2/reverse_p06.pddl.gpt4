To achieve the specified goals in the scenario described, we need to carefully sequence the actions while respecting the preconditions and desired effects of each action. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan using the actions provided:

1. **Prepare `boot`**: Since `boot` needs to be `closed` and it is already `unlocked but closed`, no action is necessary for this condition.

2. **Replace `flat tyre` with `intact tyre`**:
   - **"remove-wheel" action**: Use this action to remove `flat tyre` from `hub`, as this is essential for making space for `intact tyre`.
   - **"put-on-wheel" action**: Subsequently, use this action to place `intact tyre` onto `hub`.

3. **Ensure `intact tyre` are `inflated`**:
   - **"inflate" action**: Execute this action to inflate `intact tyre` using `pump` since `intact tyre` are now placed on the `hub` but not yet `inflated`.

4. **Ensure `nut` remains `tight` on `hub`**: Since `nut` are already `tight` on `hub`, no further action is needed for this condition.

5. **Store `flat tyre`, `wrench`, `jack`, and `pump` in `boot`**:
   - **"jack-down" action**: Since all items need to be stored in `boot`, we will use this action to organize and gather these components into the `boot`. Assuming `jack-down` can lower items back into `boot` or manipulate their positions to ensure all required items are correctly stored. If necessary, this step may involve multiple iterations of similar actions or additional details on how these items are manipulated into the `boot`.

6. **Final check on `boot`**: 
   - Since we need `boot` to be `closed` and this was part of its initial state as per the problem, we ensure that all actions have not altered this state adversely. No further action is needed here if `boot` remains `closed`.

This plan assumes that the actions have global effects and that preconditions are checked and satisfied at each step. The plan is designed based on the current understanding of how each action impacts the environment. Adjustments might be necessary if actions behave differently than expected or if they influence other elements not detailed here.
