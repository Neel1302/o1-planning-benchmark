To achieve the goal of replacing the **flat tyre** with **intact tyre** on the **hub**, ensuring the **intact tyre** are **inflated**, and meeting all other specified conditions, the following optimal plan can be executed:

### Initial Preparation:

1. **Ensure possession of necessary tools and items:**
   - **have** (have) the **jack** (tool required for lifting), **pump** (tool required for **inflate** action), and **wrench** (additional tool).
   - **Note:** These items are already in the **boot** (as per the initial state).

### For Each of the 7 **hub**:

Repeat the following steps for each **hub** (unit to be serviced):

1. **Retrieve the **jack**:**
   - Go to the **boot** (storage area).
   - **have** (pick up) the **jack**.

2. **Lift the **hub** off the **ground**:**
   - **Action:** **jack-up**
     - **Preconditions:**
       - **agent** (you) **have** the **jack**.
       - The **hub** is on the **ground** (initial position).
     - **Effect:**
       - The **hub** is no longer on the **ground** (it is elevated).
       - **agent** no longer **have** the **jack** (the tool is used in lifting).

3. **Remove the **flat tyre** from the **hub**:**
   - **Action:** **remove-wheel**
     - **Preconditions:**
       - The **hub** is not on the **ground** (it is lifted).
       - The **wheel** (**flat tyre**) is on the **hub**.
       - The **hub** is not **fastened** (in a certain state that prevents removal).
     - **Effect:**
       - **agent** **have** the **flat tyre** (you are now holding the old item).
       - The **hub** is free (the old item is removed).

4. **Place the **flat tyre** in the **boot**:**
   - Take the **flat tyre** back to the **boot** and place it there.

5. **Retrieve a **intact tyre** from the **boot**:**
   - **have** the **intact tyre** (pick up a new item).
   - **Note:** The **intact tyre** are in the **boot** and are not **inflated**.

6. **Perform the **inflate** action on the **intact tyre**:**
   - **Action:** **inflate**
     - **Preconditions:**
       - **agent** **have** the **pump** (you have the tool needed for this action).
       - The **wheel** (**intact tyre**) is not **inflated**.
       - The **wheel** is **intact** (it is the correct type).
     - **Effect:**
       - The **intact tyre** is now **inflated**.

7. **Install the **intact tyre** onto the **hub**:**
   - **Action:** **put-on-wheel**
     - **Preconditions:**
       - **agent** **have** the **intact tyre**.
       - The **hub** is free (ready for installation).
       - The **hub** is not **fastened**.
       - The **hub** is not on the **ground** (it is still elevated).
     - **Effect:**
       - The **intact tyre** is now on the **hub**.
       - The **hub** is no longer free.
       - **agent** no longer **have** the **intact tyre**.

8. **Lower the **hub** back onto the **ground**:**
   - **Action:** **jack-down**
     - **Preconditions:**
       - The **hub** is not on the **ground** (it is elevated).
       - **agent** has lifted the **hub** using the **jack**.
     - **Effect:**
       - The **hub** is back on the **ground**.
       - **agent** **have** the **jack** (you have the tool again).

9. **Return the **jack** to the **boot**:**
   - Place the **jack** back in the **boot** for future use.

### Final Steps:

1. **Ensure all items are in their proper places:**
   - **flat tyre**, **wrench**, **jack**, and **pump** are in the **boot**.

2. **Confirm the **nut** are **tight** on the **hub**:**
   - This condition remains satisfied throughout the process.

3. **Verify the **boot** is **closed**:**
   - Since the **boot** started **closed** and was never **open** (locked), it remains **closed**.

### Summary of Actions:

- **For Each **hub**:**
  1. **jack-up**: Lift the **hub** off the **ground** using the **jack**.
  2. **remove-wheel**: Remove the **flat tyre** from the **hub**.
  3. **inflate**: Prepare the **intact tyre** using the **pump**.
  4. **put-on-wheel**: Install the **intact tyre** onto the **hub**.
  5. **jack-down**: Lower the **hub** back onto the **ground** using the **jack**.
  6. Return tools and items to the **boot**.

By following this plan, all goals are achieved optimally:

- **flat tyre** are replaced with **intact tyre** on each **hub**.
- **intact tyre** are **inflated**.
- **nut** remain **tight** on the **hub**.
- Tools and removed items are stored in the **boot**.
- The **boot** remains **closed**.

This sequence of actions ensures efficiency by minimizing unnecessary steps and consolidating tasks where possible.
