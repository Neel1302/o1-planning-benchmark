To achieve the goals specified in the planning problem, we need to follow a series of actions that utilize the conditions and effects efficiently. Hereâ€™s an optimal plan to meet the requirements of your problem, step-by-step:

1. **`close` action**:
   - **Precondition**: `container` is `open`.
   - **Effect**: `container` is now `closed` and not `open`.
   - **Purpose**: This action sets the `boot` to `closed`, a required state.

2. **`remove-wheel` action**:
   - **Precondition**: `hub` is not on the `ground`, the `wheel` is currently on the `hub`, and `hub` is not `fastened`.
   - **Effect**: After the action, `agent` will hold the removed `wheel` (specifically `flat tyre`).
   - **Purpose**: This removes `flat tyre` from `hub`.

3. **`put-on-wheel` action**:
   - **Precondition**: The `agent` has the `wheel`, the `hub` is free, the `hub` is not `fastened`, and `hub` is not on the `ground`.
   - **Effect**: After the action, the `wheel` will be on the `hub`.
   - **Purpose**: This places `intact tyre` on the `hub`.

4. **`inflate` action**:
   - **Precondition**: The `agent` has a `pump`, the `wheel` is not `inflated`, and the `wheel` is `intact`.
   - **Effect**: The `wheel` will be `inflated`.
   - **Purpose**: This ensures the newly placed `intact tyre` are `inflated`.

5. **Move items back to `boot`**:
   - Given the final state requirement that `flat tyre`, `wrench`, `jack`, and `pump` should be in `boot`:
   - **Actions**:
     - Move `flat tyre` back into `boot`.
     - Verify `wrench`, `jack`, and `pump` are already in `boot`.

6. **`loosen` or `tighten` action** (if needed):
   - Depending on whether the `nut` on `hub` need to be toggled between `tight` and another state:
   - **Precondition**: The specific `nut` state change requirements are met.
   - **Effect**: Toggle the state of `nut` on `hub` as required.
   - **Purpose**: Ensure the `nut` on `hub` is `tight`.

This sequence meets all the specified conditions in your planning problem: replacing `flat tyre` with `intact tyre` on `hub`, ensuring the new `intact tyre` are `inflated`, and maintaining the other required item states and locations.
