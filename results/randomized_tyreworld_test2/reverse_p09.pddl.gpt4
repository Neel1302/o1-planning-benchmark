Given the problem and the actions defined in your domain, let's develop an optimal sequence of actions to achieve the goal described. The steps will address the following goals:

1. **Replace flat tyre with intact tyre on the hub**.
2. **Ensure intact tyre are inflated**.
3. **Ensure nut are tight on the hub**.
4. **Ensure flat tyre, wrench, jack, and pump are in the boot**.
5. **Ensure the boot is closed**.

Let's start by outlining the steps:

1. **Change boot state from unlocked to closed**:
   - Action: **close**.
     - Precondition: container is open (ensure by prior action if needed).
     - Effect: boot becomes closed.

2. **Replace flat tyre with intact tyre on the hub**:
   - Action: **remove-wheel** (assuming this action can remove flat tyre).
     - Preconditions: hub is not on ground, flat tyre on hub, hub is not fastened.
     - Effects: flat tyre removed from hub.
   - Action: **put-on-wheel** (assuming this can place intact tyre on hub).
     - Preconditions: agent has intact tyre, hub is free, hub is not fastened, hub is not on ground.
     - Effects: intact tyre placed on hub.

3. **Ensure intact tyre are inflated**:
   - Action: **inflate**.
     - Preconditions: agent has pump, intact tyre is not inflated and is intact.
     - Effects: intact tyre becomes inflated.

4. **Ensure nut are tight on the hub**:
   - If nut on hub are not tight, use action **tighten** to reset to tight if necessary.
     - Preconditions: agent has wrench, nut on hub is loose, hub is on ground.
     - Effects: nut on hub becomes tight.

5. **Ensure flat tyre, wrench, jack, and pump are in the boot**:
   - This likely involves a series of actions to place these items into boot if they are not already.

In practice, these action sequences must be tailored based on the precise initial state and the capabilities defined in the domain's actions. Note that certain steps might require additional preconditions to be met or the effects of one action might need to be aligned with the preconditions of another. This high-level plan provides a framework, but the specific sequence and feasibility depend on further details about state transitions and object interactions within the given domain.
