To solve this problem and achieve the goal of replacing the `flat tyre` (old tool) with the `intact tyre` (new tool) on the `hub` (devices), configuring the new tools, ensuring the `nut` (software) is `tight` (version 1) on the devices, and returning all tools and components to the `boot` (container) which should be locked at the end, we can follow an optimal sequence of actions.

**Note**: Due to the use of coded terms, we'll proceed by interpreting the relationships and dependencies between actions and states as described.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Unlock the Container (`boot`)**:
   - **Action**: `open` (Unlock action)
   - **Preconditions**: `boot` is `unlocked` (closed) and `closed` (locked).
   - **Effects**: `boot` becomes `open` (unlocked) and not `closed` (locked).

2. **Retrieve Necessary Tools from the Container**:
   - **Action**: `fetch` (Retrieve item)
   - **Items to Retrieve**:
     - `jack` (Lifting tool)
     - `wrench` (Tool needed for software actions)
     - `intact tyre` (New tool)
     - `pump` (Tool needed for configuring the new tool)
   - **Preconditions**: Each item is inside the `boot` (container), which is `open` (unlocked).
   - **Effects**: Each item is now held by the `agent` (operator) and not inside the `boot`.

3. **Upgrade the Software on the Device (Optional)**:
   - **Action**: `loosen` (Upgrade software)
   - **Preconditions**:
     - `agent` has `wrench`.
     - The `nut` on `hub` is `tight` (version 1).
     - `hub` is on the `ground` (original position).
   - **Effects**: The `nut` on `hub` becomes `loose` (upgraded) and not `tight`.

   *Note*: This step is optional if the software upgrade is not required or conflicts with the goal of the `nut` being `tight` on the devices. If it's necessary for allowing the device to be powered off, include this step.

4. **Lift the Device Off Its Original Position**:
   - **Action**: `jack-up` (Lift device)
   - **Preconditions**:
     - `agent` holds `jack`.
     - `hub` is on the `ground`.
   - **Effects**:
     - `hub` is no longer on the `ground`.
     - `agent` no longer holds `jack`.

5. **Power Off the Device**:
   - **Action**: `undo` (Power off device)
   - **Preconditions**:
     - `hub` is not on `ground`.
     - `hub` is `fastened` (powered on).
     - `agent` has `wrench`.
     - The `nut` on `hub` is `loose` (if step 3 was performed).
   - **Effects**:
     - `hub` is not `fastened` (powered off).
     - `hub` is no longer `loose`.
     - `agent` has the `nut`.

   *Note*: If the software was not upgraded in step 3, adjust the preconditions accordingly.

6. **Remove the Old Tool from the Device**:
   - **Action**: `remove-wheel` (Remove component)
   - **Preconditions**:
     - `hub` is not on `ground`.
     - The `flat tyre` (old tool) is on `hub`.
     - `hub` is not `fastened` (powered off).
   - **Effects**:
     - `agent` holds the removed `flat tyre`.
     - The `hub` is now free (no tool attached).

7. **Install the New Tool onto the Device**:
   - **Action**: `put-on-wheel` (Install component)
   - **Preconditions**:
     - `agent` has the `intact tyre` (new tool).
     - `hub` is free.
     - `hub` is not `fastened`.
     - `hub` is not on `ground`.
   - **Effects**:
     - The `intact tyre` is now on `hub`.
     - `hub` is no longer free.
     - `agent` no longer holds the `intact tyre`.

8. **Configure the New Tool**:
   - **Action**: `inflate` (Configure tool)
   - **Preconditions**:
     - `agent` has `pump`.
     - The `intact tyre` is on `hub`.
     - The `intact tyre` is not `inflated` (configured).
   - **Effects**:
     - The `intact tyre` becomes `inflated` (configured).

9. **Power On the Device** (Optional):
   - **Action**: `do-up` (Power on device)
   - **Preconditions**:
     - `agent` has `wrench`.
     - `hub` is not `fastened` (powered off).
     - `hub` is not on `ground`.
     - `agent` has the `nut` to be installed.
   - **Effects**:
     - The `nut` is now `loose` on `hub`.
     - `hub` is `fastened` (powered on).
     - `agent` no longer holds the `nut`.

   *Note*: If the software should remain at `tight`, and the device doesn't need to be powered on for the goals, this step can be adjusted or omitted.

10. **Lower the Device Back to Its Original Position**:
    - **Action**: `jack-down` (Lower device)
    - **Preconditions**:
      - `agent` holds the `hub` off the `ground`.
    - **Effects**:
      - `hub` is back on the `ground`.
      - `agent` holds `jack`.

11. **Return Tools and Old Components to the Container**:
    - **Action**: `put-away` (Store item)
    - **Items to Return**:
      - `flat tyre` (old tool)
      - `jack` (lifting tool)
      - `wrench` (if not needed anymore)
      - `pump` (after configuration)
    - **Preconditions**:
      - Each item is held by `agent`.
      - The `boot` is `open` (unlocked).
    - **Effects**: Each item is placed inside the `boot` and no longer held by `agent`.

12. **Lock the Container**:
    - **Action**: `close` (Lock action)
    - **Preconditions**: The `boot` is `open` (unlocked).
    - **Effects**: The `boot` becomes `closed` (locked) and not `open`.

**Summary of the Plan**:
- Unlock the container and gather the necessary tools.
- Upgrade software if required (adjust based on goals).
- Lift the device off its position to work on it.
- Power off the device to safely remove components.
- Remove the old tool and install the new, configuring it afterward.
- Power on the device if necessary.
- Lower the device back to its original position.
- Return all tools and the old component to the container.
- Lock the container to secure the items.

By following this sequence, all goals are achieved:
- **flat tyre** (old tool) is replaced with **intact tyre** (new tool) on the **hub** (devices).
- The new tools are configured (**inflated**).
- The **nut** (software) remains **tight** (version 1) on the devices (adjust steps if software changes were made).
- The old tools and all used equipment are stored back in the **boot** (container).
- The container is locked (**closed**) at the end.

This plan ensures all preconditions are met for each action, and all effects lead toward satisfying the goals. It is optimal in that it performs the minimal necessary steps in the correct order to achieve the desired end state.
