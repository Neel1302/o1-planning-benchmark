To solve the planning problem as described, we need to create a sequence of actions that achieves the stated goals within the given constraints and initial conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to plan the solution:

### Initial State:
- **flat tyre** are on the **hub**.
- **intact tyre** are in the **boot** and are not **inflated**.
- The **boot** is **closed**.
- The **nut** are **tight** on the **hub**.
- The **hub** are on the **ground** and are **fastened**.
- Objects **jack**, **pump**, and **wrench** are also in the **boot**.

### Goals:
- Replace **flat tyre** with **intact tyre** on the **hub**.
- **intact tyre** should be **inflated**.
- The **nut** should remain **tight** on the **hub**.
- All items (**flat tyre**, **wrench**, **jack**, **pump**) should end up in the **boot**.
- The **boot** should be **closed**.

### Steps to Achieve Goals:

1. **"remove-wheel" action**:
   - Remove **flat tyre** from **hub** since **flat tyre** is currently on the **hub** and it needs to be replaced. This action clears **flat tyre** from the **hub**.

2. **"put-on-wheel" action**:
   - Place **intact tyre** from the **boot** onto the **hub**. This action puts **intact tyre** in position to be **inflated**.

3. **"inflate" action**:
   - **inflate** the **intact tyre** using **pump**. This action changes the state of **intact tyre** to be **inflated**, fulfilling one of the goal conditions.

4. **"open" action**:
   - Given the precondition that the **container** is **unlocked** and **closed**, perform action to change the state of **container** to **open** and not **closed**. This step may be required if **boot**'s **closed** state needs adjusting based on other intermediate states not described.

5. **"close" action**:
   - If **container** was changed to **open**, revert it to **closed** to maintain or restore the **boot** state to **closed**.

6. Gather all items (**flat tyre**, **wrench**, **jack**, **pump**) back into the **boot**. This step involves physically moving these items back to the **boot**, although specific actions are not detailed in the list provided.

By executing these steps in sequence, the plan satisfies all conditions and goals described in the problem. This assumes all actions can be initiated based on their preconditions being met at the time of execution.
