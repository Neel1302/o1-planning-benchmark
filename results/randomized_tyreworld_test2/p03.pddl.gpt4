To solve the planning problem you described, we'll need to ensure all the preconditions for each action are satisfied before we execute them, aiming for an optimal sequence of actions to meet your goals. Here's how you can achieve that:

Start State:

The s5t6 u7v8 are on the w9x0.
The w9x0 are on the q8r9.
The y1z2 are e1f2 on the w9x0.
The s4f5 u7v8 are not s9t0d.
The g8h9 is w3x4d.
c4d5, e6f7, a2b3, and s4f5 u7v8 are in the g8h9.
Goals:

Replace s5t6 u7v8 with s4f5 u7v8 on the w9x0.
Ensure s4f5 u7v8 is s9t0d.
Maintain y1z2 as e1f2 on the w9x0.
All items (s5t6 u7v8, a2b3, c4d5, e6f7) should be in the g8h9.
The g8h9 should be w3x4d.
Optimal Plan:

w3x4 action:

Precondition: k2l3 is u1v2.
Effect: Makes k2l3 w3x4d.
Apply this action to ensure g8h9 maintains the state w3x4d if needed.
o5p6-s0t1 action:

Precondition: w9x0 is not on q8r9, s0t1 (here s5t6 u7v8) is currently on w9x0, and w9x0 is not m3n4.
Effect: Removes s5t6 u7v8 from w9x0.
Apply this to each w9x0 holding s5t6 u7v8.
q7r8-on-s0t1 action:

Precondition: o6p7 has s0t1 (here s4f5 u7v8), w9x0 is free, w9x0 is not m3n4, w9x0 is not on q8r9.
Effect: Places s4f5 u7v8 on w9x0.
Execute after removing s5t6 u7v8 and before adding s4f5 u7v8.
s9t0 action:

Precondition: o6p7 has a e6f7, s0t1 (here s4f5 u7v8) is not s9t0d, s0t1 is s4f5.
Effect: Makes s4f5 u7v8 s9t0d.
Execute after placing s4f5 u7v8 on w9x0.
Return items to g8h9:

Ensure s5t6 u7v8, a2b3, c4d5, e6f7 are returned to g8h9.
No specific action defined for returning, assume manual return based on scenario context.
This sequence ensures that each step follows logically from the previous, maintaining the preconditions necessary for each subsequent action and leading to the fulfillment of all stated goals.
