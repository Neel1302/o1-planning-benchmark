      - *Effect*: G8H9 is now closed.

17. **Ensure all items are in the G8H9 and it's w3x4d.**
    - Verify that the S5T6 U7V8, A2B3, C4D5, and E6F7 are in the G8H9 and that the G8H9 is closed.

**Summary of the Plan:**

- Open the G8H9 to access necessary tools and components.
- Use the A2B3 to modify the Y1Z2 on the W9X0.
- Lift the W9X0 off the Q8R9 using the C4D5.
- Remove the Y1Z2 and S5T6 U7V8 from the W9X0.
- Store the S5T6 U7V8 back in the G8H9.
- Retrieve and S9T0 the S4F5 U7V8 using the E6F7.
- Install the S4F5 U7V8 onto the W9X0.
- Reinstall the Y1Z2 onto the W9X0 and revert it to E1F2.
- Lower the W9X0 back onto the Q8R9.
- Close the G8H9, ensuring all tools and removed components are safely stored.

This sequence of actions efficiently replaces the S5T6 U7V8 with the S9T0d S4F5 U7V8 on the W9X0, ensures the Y1Z2 is E1F2 on the W9X0, stores the removed items in the G8H9, and leaves the G8H9 w3x4d, fulfilling all your goals.
