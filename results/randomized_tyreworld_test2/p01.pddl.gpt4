Given the problem and the set of actions defined, here's an optimal plan to achieve the stated goals:

"u1v2" action: Execute the "u1v2" action to set the state of k2l3 to u1v2, making it no longer w3x4d. This step is necessary to meet the preconditions for other actions that require k2l3 to be u1v2.

"g3h4" action: Execute the "g3h4" action to lift w9x0 off q8r9 using c4d5. This action requires o6p7 to manipulate c4d5, and after completion, w9x0 will no longer be on q8r9.

"i5j6" action: Execute the "i5j6" action to lower w9x0 back onto q8r9. This action involves using c4d5 to place w9x0 back on q8r9, meeting certain conditions for subsequent actions.

"f8k1" action: If necessary, execute the "f8k1" action to set y1z2 on w9x0 to e1f2. This step ensures that the state of y1z2 on w9x0 matches the goal.

"o5p6-s0t1" action: Execute the "o5p6-s0t1" action to remove s5t6 u7v8 from w9x0. This action involves o6p7 manipulating the item, making w9x0 free from s5t6 u7v8.

"q7r8-on-s0t1" action: Execute the "q7r8-on-s0t1" action to place s4f5 u7v8 on w9x0. This step is necessary to put the new item in place on w9x0.

"s9t0" action: Execute the "s9t0" action to s9t0 s4f5 u7v8 using e6f7. This action changes the state of s4f5 u7v8 to s9t0d, aligning it with the goal.

"w3x4" action: Finally, execute the "w3x4" action to change the state of k2l3 back to w3x4d. This ensures that the final condition of g8h9 being w3x4d is met.

This plan is optimal in that it aims to minimize the number of steps and ensures that all conditions and goals are met using the available actions. Each step sequentially builds upon the state changes required to reach the final goal states for each of the items involved.
