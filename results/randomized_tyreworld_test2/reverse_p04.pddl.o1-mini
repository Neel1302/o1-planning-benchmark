To achieve your goal of replacing **flat tyre** with **intact tyre** on the **hub**, ensuring that **intact tyre** becomes **inflated**, and maintaining the desired states of other objects, the following optimal sequence of actions can be executed:

### **Step-by-Step Plan**

1. **Lift the hub Off the ground**
   - **Action:** `jack-up`
   - **Purpose:** This action lifts the **hub** off the **ground**, making it accessible for modifications. It uses a **jack** and requires that the **agent** is ready to perform the lift.

2. **Remove flat tyre from the hub**
   - **Action:** `remove-wheel`
   - **Purpose:** This action removes **flat tyre** from the **hub**. It ensures that the **hub** is free and not in the **fastened** state, allowing for the placement of a new object.

3. **Transfer intact tyre to agent's Possession**
   - **Action:** `open`
   - **Purpose:** Changes the state of **container** to `open`, effectively transferring **intact tyre** from **boot** to **agent**. This is necessary to prepare **intact tyre** for placement on the **hub**.

4. **Place intact tyre on the hub**
   - **Action:** `put-on-wheel`
   - **Purpose:** Places **intact tyre** onto the **hub**. This action requires that **agent** currently holds **intact tyre**, the **hub** is free, not in the **fastened** state, and not on the **ground**.

5. **Transform intact tyre to inflated**
   - **Action:** `inflate`
   - **Purpose:** Changes **intact tyre** to **inflated**. This fulfills the requirement that **intact tyre** should be **inflated** on the **hub**.

6. **Lower the hub Back to ground**
   - **Action:** `jack-down`
   - **Purpose:** Lowers the **hub** back onto the **ground**, restoring it to its original position after the modifications have been made.

### **Summary of Actions**

1. `jack-up` – Lift the **hub** off the **ground**.
2. `remove-wheel` – Remove **flat tyre** from the **hub**.
3. `open` – Transfer **intact tyre** to **agent**.
4. `put-on-wheel` – Place **intact tyre** on the **hub**.
5. `inflate` – Transform **intact tyre** to **inflated**.
6. `jack-down` – Lower the **hub** back to **ground**.

### **Final State Achieved**

- **hub** has **intact tyre** transformed into **inflated**.
- **flat tyre**, **wrench**, **jack**, and **pump** are all contained within the **boot**.
- The **boot** remains in the **closed** state.
- **nut** remains as **tight** on the **hub**.

This sequence ensures that all preconditions are met for each action and that the final goal state is achieved efficiently.
