To solve the given planning problem and achieve the goal of replacing **flat tyre** with **intact tyre** on the **hub**, ensuring that **intact tyre** is **inflated** and that the **nut** are **tight** on the **hub**, and finally returning the **flat tyre**, **wrench**, **jack**, and **pump** to the **boot**, while the **boot** remains **closed**, the following sequence of actions provides an optimal plan:

1. **Perform the "loosen" action**:

   - *Preconditions*:
     - The **agent** has an **wrench**.
     - The **nut** on the **hub** is **tight**.
     - The **hub** is on the **ground**.
   - *Effects*:
     - The **nut** on the **hub** becomes **loose**.
     - The **nut** is no longer **tight**.

2. **Perform the "jack-up" action**:
   - *Purpose*: Lift the **hub** off the **ground** using the **jack**.
   - *Preconditions*:
     - The **agent** has the **jack**.
     - The **hub** is on the **ground**.
   - *Effects*:
     - The **hub** is no longer on the **ground**.
     - The **agent** no longer has the **jack**.

3. **Perform the "undo" action**:
   - *Purpose*: Remove the **nut** from the **hub**, powering it down.
   - *Preconditions*:
     - The **hub** is not on the **ground**.
     - The **hub** is **fastened**.
     - The **agent** has the **wrench**.
     - The **nut** is **loose**.
   - *Effects*:
     - The **agent** has the **nut**.
     - The **hub** is no longer **fastened**.

4. **Perform the "remove-wheel" action**:
   - *Purpose*: Remove the **flat tyre** (**wheel**) from the **hub**.
   - *Preconditions*:
     - The **hub** is not on the **ground**.
     - The **flat tyre** (**wheel**) is on the **hub**.
     - The **hub** is not **fastened**.
   - *Effects*:
     - The **agent** has the removed **flat tyre** (**wheel**).
     - The **flat tyre** is no longer on the **hub**.

5. **Place the "flat tyre" into the "boot"**:
   - *Purpose*: Store the removed **flat tyre** in the **boot**.
   - *Assumption*: Direct placement as per domain rules.

6. **Retrieve the "intact tyre" from the "boot"**:
   - *Purpose*: Obtain the new **intact tyre** for installation.
   - *Assumption*: Direct retrieval as per domain rules.

7. **Perform the "inflate" action**:
   - *Purpose*: **inflate** the **intact tyre** using the **pump**.
   - *Preconditions*:
     - The **agent** has the **pump**.
     - The **intact tyre** (**wheel**) is not **inflated**.
     - The **wheel** is **intact**.
   - *Effects*:
     - The **intact tyre** is now **inflated**.

8. **Perform the "put-on-wheel" action**:
   - *Purpose*: Install the **intact tyre** (**wheel**) onto the **hub**.
   - *Preconditions*:
     - The **agent** has the **intact tyre** (**wheel**).
     - The **hub** is free (no **wheel** installed).
     - The **hub** is not **fastened**.
     - The **hub** is not on the **ground**.
   - *Effects*:
     - The **intact tyre** is now on the **hub**.
     - The **hub** is no longer free.
     - The **agent** no longer has the **intact tyre**.

9. **Perform the "do-up" action**:
   - *Purpose*: Reinstall the **nut** back into the **hub**, powering it up.
   - *Preconditions*:
     - The **agent** has the **nut**.
     - The **hub** is not **fastened**.
     - The **hub** is not on the **ground**.
   - *Effects*:
     - The **nut** is now **loose** on the **hub**.
     - The **hub** is **fastened**.
     - The **agent** no longer has the **nut**.

10. **Perform the "jack-down" action**:
    - *Purpose*: Lower the **hub** back onto the **ground**.
    - *Preconditions*:
      - The **agent** has lifted the **hub** off the **ground**.
    - *Effects*:
      - The **hub** is back on the **ground**.
      - The **agent** now has the **jack**.

11. **Perform the "tighten" action**:
    - *Purpose*: Change the **nut** on the **hub** from **loose** back to **tight**.
    - *Preconditions*:
      - The **agent** has an **wrench**.
      - The **nut** on the **hub** is **loose**.
      - The **hub** is on the **ground**.
    - *Effects*:
      - The **nut** on the **hub** is now **tight**.
      - The **nut** is no longer **loose**.

12. **Return the tools and "flat tyre" to the "boot"**:
    - *Purpose*: Place the **jack**, **pump**, **wrench**, and **flat tyre** back into the **boot**.
    - *Assumption*: Direct placement as per domain rules.

**Summary of the Plan**:

- **Step 1**: Disable the **nut** on the **hub**.
- **Step 2**: Lift the **hub** off the **ground**.
- **Step 3**: Power down and remove the **nut** from the **hub**.
- **Step 4**: Remove the old **flat tyre** from the **hub**.
- **Step 5**: Store the old **flat tyre** in the **boot**.
- **Step 6**: Retrieve the new **intact tyre** from the **boot**.
- **Step 7**: **inflate** the new **intact tyre** using the **pump**.
- **Step 8**: Install the new **intact tyre** onto the **hub**.
- **Step 9**: Reinstall the **nut** into the **hub** to power it up.
- **Step 10**: Lower the **hub** back onto the **ground**.
- **Step 11**: Re-enable the **nut** on the **hub**.
- **Step 12**: Return all tools and the old part to the **boot**.

This plan efficiently accomplishes the goal with the minimal necessary actions while adhering to the preconditions and effects defined in the domain. All tools and the old **flat tyre** are returned to the **boot**, which remains **closed**, fulfilling the final condition of the problem.
