Certainly! Here's an optimal sequence of actions to achieve your goal:

1. **u1v2**: Open the g8h9 (storage unit).  
   *Preconditions*: The g8h9 is 930d (closed) and w3x4d (locked).  
   *Effects*: The g8h9 is now u1v2 (unlocked) and not w3x4d (locked).

2. **y5z6**: Retrieve the c4d5 from the g8h9.  
   *Preconditions*: The c4d5 is inside the g8h9, and the g8h9 is u1v2 (unlocked).  
   *Effects*: The c4d5 is now held by the o6p7 (you) and not inside the g8h9.

3. **y5z6**: Retrieve the e6f7 from the g8h9.  
   *Preconditions & Effects*: Same as above for e6f7.

4. **y5z6**: Retrieve the a2b3 from the g8h9.  
   *Preconditions & Effects*: Same as above for a2b3.

5. **y5z6**: Retrieve all s4f5 u7v8 units from the g8h9.  
   *Preconditions & Effects*: Repeat for each s4f5 u7v8.

For each of the four w9x0 units, perform the following steps:

6. **c9d0**: Change the y1z2 from e1f2 to f03k on the w9x0.  
   *Preconditions*: You have the a2b3, the y1z2 on the w9x0 is e1f2, and the w9x0 is on the q8r9.  
   *Effects*: The y1z2 on the w9x0 is now f03k.

7. **g3h4**: Lift the w9x0 off the q8r9 using the c4d5.  
   *Preconditions*: You e5f6 (use) the c4d5, and the w9x0 is on the q8r9.  
   *Effects*: The w9x0 is no longer on the q8r9, and you no longer e5f6 the c4d5.

8. **k1l2**: Unlock the w9x0 and remove the y1z2.  
   *Preconditions*: The w9x0 is not on the q8r9, the w9x0 is m3n4 (locked), you have the a2b3, and the y1z2 is f03k.  
   *Effects*: You have the y1z2, and the w9x0 is now not m3n4 (unlocked).

9. **o5p6-s0t1**: Remove the s5t6 u7v8 from the w9x0.  
   *Preconditions*: The w9x0 is not on the q8r9, the s5t6 u7v8 (s0t1) is on the w9x0, and the w9x0 is not m3n4 (unlocked).  
   *Effects*: You e5f6 (hold) the s5t6 u7v8, and the w9x0 is now free (no u7v8 installed).

10. **s9t0**: Configure the s4f5 u7v8 using the e6f7.  
    *Preconditions*: You have the e6f7, the s4f5 u7v8 is not s9t0d (configured), and it is s4f5.  
    *Effects*: The s4f5 u7v8 is now s9t0d.

11. **q7r8-on-s0t1**: Install the s4f5 u7v8 onto the w9x0.  
    *Preconditions*: You have the s4f5 u7v8, the w9x0 is free, not m3n4 (unlocked), and not on the q8r9.  
    *Effects*: The s4f5 u7v8 is now on the w9x0, and you no longer e5f6 the s4f5 u7v8.

12. **k7l8**: Lock the w9x0 and reinstall the y1z2.  
    *Preconditions*: You have the a2b3, the w9x0 is not m3n4, not on the q8r9, and you have the y1z2.  
    *Effects*: The y1z2 is f03k on the w9x0, the w9x0 is m3n4 (locked), and you no longer have the y1z2.

13. **i5j6**: Lower the w9x0 back onto the q8r9 using the c4d5.  
    *Preconditions*: You e5f6 the w9x0 off the q8r9.  
    *Effects*: The w9x0 is back on the q8r9, and you e5f6 the c4d5.

14. **f8k1**: Reset the y1z2 from f03k back to e1f2 on the w9x0.  
    *Preconditions*: You have the a2b3, the y1z2 on the w9x0 is f03k, and the w9x0 is on the q8r9.  
    *Effects*: The y1z2 on the w9x0 is e1f2.

After all w9x0 units have been processed:

15. **q7r8-away**: Return all s5t6 u7v8 units to the g8h9.  
    *Preconditions*: You e5f6 the s5t6 u7v8 and the g8h9 is u1v2 (unlocked).  
    *Effects*: The s5t6 u7v8 are inside the g8h9, and you no longer e5f6 them.

16. **q7r8-away**: Return the c4d5, e6f7, and a2b3 to the g8h9.  
    *Preconditions & Effects*: Repeat for each item.

17. **w3x4**: Close the g8h9.  
    *Preconditions*: The g8h9 is u1v2 (unlocked).  
    *Effects*: The g8h9 is w3x4d (locked) and not u1v2.

This plan ensures that:

- The s5t6 u7v8 are replaced with s4f5 u7v8 on all w9x0 units.
- The s4f5 u7v8 are configured (s9t0d).
- The y1z2 are e1f2 on the w9x0 units.
- The s5t6 u7v8, a2b3, c4d5, and e6f7 are returned to the g8h9.
- The g8h9 is closed and w3x4d.

This sequence minimizes the number of actions by efficiently retrieving and returning items and properly sequencing operations to prevent unnecessary steps.
