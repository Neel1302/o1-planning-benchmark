Certainly! To achieve the goal of replacing `s5t6 u7v8` with `s4f5 u7v8` on the `w9x0`, while ensuring all other conditions are met, the following **optimal plan** consists of **8 actions** executed in sequence:

1. **c9d0**
   - **Purpose:** Change `y1z2` on `w9x0` from `e1f2` to `f03k`.
   - **Reasoning:** This sets up the necessary condition for modifying the `w9x0` state in subsequent steps.

2. **g3h4**
   - **Purpose:** Lift the `w9x0` off the `q8r9` using a `c4d5`.
   - **Reasoning:** Removes `w9x0` from its current position, allowing further modifications.

3. **k1l2**
   - **Purpose:** Change the state of `w9x0` from `m3n4` to not `m3n4`.
   - **Reasoning:** This is necessary to free `w9x0` for the replacement of `s5t6 u7v8`.

4. **o5p6-s0t1**
   - **Purpose:** Remove `s5t6 u7v8` from the `w9x0`.
   - **Reasoning:** Clears the `w9x0` to make room for `s4f5 u7v8`.

5. **q7r8-on-s0t1**
   - **Purpose:** Place `s4f5 u7v8` onto the `w9x0`.
   - **Reasoning:** Completes the replacement of `s5t6 u7v8` with `s4f5 u7v8`.

6. **s9t0**
   - **Purpose:** Transform `s4f5 u7v8` into `s9t0d`.
   - **Reasoning:** Ensures that `s4f5 u7v8` meets the desired state `s9t0d`.

7. **i5j6**
   - **Purpose:** Lower the `w9x0` back onto the `q8r9`.
   - **Reasoning:** Restores `w9x0` to its original position after modifications.

8. **f8k1**
   - **Purpose:** Change `y1z2` on `w9x0` back from `f03k` to `e1f2`.
   - **Reasoning:** Ensures that the `y1z2` meets the goal condition of being `e1f2` on the `w9x0`.

### **Summary of the Optimal Plan:**

1. **c9d0**
2. **g3h4**
3. **k1l2**
4. **o5p6-s0t1**
5. **q7r8-on-s0t1**
6. **s9t0**
7. **i5j6**
8. **f8k1**

### **Explanation:**

- **Initialization:** Start by changing the state of `y1z2` to allow modifications to `w9x0`.
- **Modification:** Lift `w9x0` and alter its state to make it receptive to the replacement.
- **Replacement:** Remove the existing `s5t6 u7v8` and place `s4f5 u7v8` in its stead.
- **Finalization:** Transform `s4f5 u7v8` to the desired state `s9t0d`, lower `w9x0` back, and restore `y1z2` to its original state.

This sequence ensures that all preconditions for each action are met and that the goal state is achieved efficiently.
