To achieve the goals set out in your planning problem, I will outline the sequence of actions needed according to the actions and their preconditions/effects that you provided. Here's a step-by-step plan to reach the desired state:

1. **w3x4 Action**: The current state of `k2l3` is `930d` and `w3x4d`. Since the precondition for the `w3x4` action is that the `k2l3` is `u1v2`, we need to ensure this state. Assuming from the context that `k2l3` can transition from `930d` to `u1v2`:
   - Execute `w3x4` action to make `k2l3` `w3x4d` and `not u1v2`.

2. **g3h4 Action**: Since the `g8h9` is `w3x4d`, you need to remove `w9x0` from `q8r9` to manipulate the items on it:
   - Execute `g3h4` to lift `w9x0` off `q8r9` using `c4d5`, setting the `w9x0` to not be on `q8r9`.

3. **o5p6-s0t1 Action**: To remove `s5t6 u7v8` from `w9x0`, assuming `s5t6 u7v8` is `s0t1` and `w9x0` is free and not `m3n4`:
   - Execute `o5p6-s0t1` to remove `s5t6 u7v8` from `w9x0`.

4. **q7r8-on-s0t1 Action**: To place `s4f5 u7v8` onto `w9x0`, assuming `s4f5 u7v8` is `s0t1` and it is held by `o6p7`:
   - Execute `q7r8-on-s0t1` to place `s4f5 u7v8` on `w9x0`.

5. **s9t0 Action**: Since `s4f5 u7v8` should be `s9t0d`, and it is `s0t1`:
   - Execute `s9t0` to set `s4f5 u7v8` as `s9t0d`.

6. **i5j6 Action**: To restore `w9x0` back on `q8r9`:
   - Execute `i5j6` to lower `w9x0` back to `q8r9`.

7. **c9d0 and f8k1 Actions**: To ensure `y1z2` is `e1f2` on `w9x0`, if itâ€™s not already in this state:
   - Execute `c9d0` if `y1z2` is not `e1f2` to make it `f03k`, and then `f8k1` to revert it back to `e1f2`.

8. **u1v2 Action**: Finally, to revert the state of `k2l3` back to a suitable form if necessary:
   - Execute `u1v2` if you need to set `k2l3` back from `w3x4d` to `u1v2`.

This plan assumes the availability of certain transitions between states that might need additional actions or conditions not specified in your original list. It also assumes that actions can be performed sequentially as needed, without interference. This optimal plan seeks to achieve the goals you specified by only using the necessary actions to alter the states as required.
