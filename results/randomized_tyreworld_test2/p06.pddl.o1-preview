To solve the problem, we need an optimal plan that replaces the `s5t6 u7v8` (old components) with the `s4f5 u7v8` (new components) on the `w9x0` (machines), ensures that the `s4f5 u7v8` are `s9t0d` (activated/configured), and returns the tools and old components to the `g8h9` (storage container), which should be closed at the end. The `y1z2` (covers) should remain `e1f2` (secured/unlocked) on the `w9x0`.

Here is the optimal plan:

1. **Open the Storage Container**:
   - **Action**: `u1v2` (Open `g8h9`)
   - **Preconditions**: `g8h9` is `930d` (unlocked) and `w3x4d` (closed)
   - **Effects**: `g8h9` becomes `u1v2` (open) and not `w3x4d`

2. **Retrieve Tools from `g8h9`**:
   - **Action**: `y5z6` (Retrieve items)
   - **Items to Retrieve**: `a2b3` (tool), `c4d5` (lifting device), and `e6f7` (tool)
   - **Preconditions**: Each item is inside `g8h9`, which is `u1v2` (open)
   - **Effects**: Agent `o6p7` holds each item after retrieval

3. **For Each `w9x0` (Repeat Steps 3a to 3k for each machine)**:

   a. **Lock the Cover on `w9x0`**:
      - **Action**: `c9d0` (Lock `y1z2`)
      - **Preconditions**: `o6p7` has `a2b3`, `y1z2` on `w9x0` is `e1f2`, `w9x0` is on `q8r9` (ground)
      - **Effects**: `y1z2` on `w9x0` becomes `f03k` (locked)

      - **Effects**: `o6p7` holds `y1z2`, `w9x0` becomes not `m3n4`

   d. **Remove the Old Component from `w9x0`**:
      - **Action**: `o5p6-s0t1` (Remove `s5t6 u7v8`)
      - **Preconditions**: `w9x0` is not on `q8r9`, `s5t6 u7v8` is on `w9x0`, `w9x0` is not `m3n4`
      - **Effects**: `o6p7` holds `s5t6 u7v8`, `w9x0` becomes free (no component)

   e. **Place the Old Component into `g8h9`**:
      - **Action**: `q7r8-away` (Store `s5t6 u7v8` in `g8h9`)
      - **Preconditions**: `o6p7` holds `s5t6 u7v8`, `g8h9` is `u1v2` (open)
      - **Effects**: `s5t6 u7v8` is inside `g8h9`, `o6p7` no longer holds `s5t6 u7v8`

   f. **Retrieve the New Component from `g8h9`**:
      - **Action**: `y5z6` (Retrieve `s4f5 u7v8`)
      - **Preconditions**: `s4f5 u7v8` is inside `g8h9`, which is `u1v2` (open)
      - **Effects**: `o6p7` holds `s4f5 u7v8`

   g. **Install the New Component onto `w9x0`**:
      - **Action**: `q7r8-on-s0t1` (Install `s4f5 u7v8`)
      - **Preconditions**: `o6p7` has `s4f5 u7v8`, `w9x0` is free, `w9x0` is not `m3n4`, `w9x0` is not on `q8r9`
      - **Effects**: `s4f5 u7v8` is on `w9x0`, `w9x0` becomes not free, `o6p7` no longer holds `s4f5 u7v8`

   h. **Activate/Configure the New Component**:
      - **Action**: `s9t0` (Configure `s4f5 u7v8` using `e6f7`)
      - **Preconditions**: `o6p7` has `e6f7`, `s4f5 u7v8` is not `s9t0d`, `s4f5 u7v8` is on `w9x0`
      - **Effects**: `s4f5 u7v8` becomes `s9t0d`

   i. **Reattach the Cover onto `w9x0`**:
      - **Action**: `k7l8` (Attach `y1z2`)
      - **Preconditions**: `o6p7` has `a2b3`, `w9x0` is not `m3n4`, `w9x0` is not on `q8r9`, `o6p7` has `y1z2` to be `m3n4`
      - **Effects**: `y1z2` is `f03k` on `w9x0`, `w9x0` becomes `m3n4`, `o6p7` no longer holds `y1z2`

   j. **Lower the `w9x0` Back to the Ground**:
      - **Action**: `i5j6` (Lower `w9x0`)
      - **Preconditions**: `o6p7` holds `w9x0` off `q8r9`
      - **Effects**: `w9x0` is on `q8r9`, `o6p7` holds `c4d5`

   k. **Unlock the Cover on `w9x0`**:
      - **Action**: `f8k1` (Unlock `y1z2`)
      - **Preconditions**: `o6p7` has `a2b3`, `y1z2` on `w9x0` is `f03k`, `w9x0` is on `q8r9`
      - **Effects**: `y1z2` on `w9x0` becomes `e1f2`

4. **Return Tools to `g8h9`**:
   - **Action**: `q7r8-away` (Store items in `g8h9`)
   - **Items to Return**: `c4d5`, `e6f7`, `a2b3`
   - **Preconditions**: Each item is held by `o6p7`, `g8h9` is `u1v2` (open)
   - **Effects**: Each item is inside `g8h9`, `o6p7` no longer holds the items

5. **Close the Storage Container**:
   - **Action**: `w3x4` (Close `g8h9`)
   - **Preconditions**: `g8h9` is `u1v2` (open)
   - **Effects**: `g8h9` becomes `w3x4d` (closed) and not `u1v2`

This plan ensures that:
- All `s5t6 u7v8` (old components), `a2b3`, `c4d5`, and `e6f7` are stored in the `g8h9` at the end.
- The `s4f5 u7v8` (new components) are installed and `s9t0d` (configured) on the `w9x0`.
- The `y1z2` (covers) are `e1f2` (secured/unlocked) on the `w9x0`.
- The `g8h9` is closed at the end.

By following this sequence of actions, the goal state is achieved efficiently, adhering to all the preconditions and effects defined in the domain.
