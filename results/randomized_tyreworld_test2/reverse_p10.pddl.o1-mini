To achieve the goal of replacing **flat tyre** with **intact tyre** on the **hub**, ensuring that **intact tyre** becomes **inflated**, and maintaining the specified conditions for other components, the following optimal sequence of actions can be executed:

### Optimal Plan Sequence:

1. **open**  
   *Precondition:* `container` is `unlocked` and `closed`.  
   *Effect:* `container` becomes `open` and `closed` is removed.

2. **close**  
   *Precondition:* `container` is `open`.  
   *Effect:* `container` becomes `closed` and `open` is removed.

3. **inflate**  
   *Precondition:* `agent` has an `pump`, `wheel` is not `inflated`, and `wheel` is `intact`.  
   *Effect:* `wheel` becomes `inflated`.

4. **remove-wheel**  
   *Precondition:* `hub` is not on `ground`, `wheel` is on `hub`, and `hub` is not `fastened`.  
   *Effect:* `agent` holds the `wheel`, and `wheel` is removed from `hub`.

5. **put-on-wheel**  
   *Precondition:* `agent` has `wheel`, `hub` is free, `hub` is not `fastened`, and `hub` is not on `ground`.  
   *Effect:* `wheel` is placed on `hub`, `hub` is no longer free, and `agent` no longer holds `wheel`.

6. **do-up**  
   *Precondition:* `agent` has `wrench`, `hub` is not `fastened`, `hub` is not on `ground`, and `agent` has `nut` as `fastened`.  
   *Effect:* `nut` becomes `loose` on `hub`, `hub` becomes `fastened`, and `agent` no longer holds `nut`.

7. **undo**  
   *Precondition:* `hub` is not on `ground`, `hub` is `fastened`, `agent` has `wrench`, and `nut` is `loose`.  
   *Effect:* `agent` holds `nut`, `hub` is no longer `fastened`, and `hub` is no longer `loose`.

8. **jack-up**  
   *Precondition:* `agent` needs to `have` a `jack`, and `hub` is on `ground`.  
   *Effect:* `hub` is lifted off `ground`, and `agent` no longer `have` the `jack`.

9. **jack-down**  
   *Precondition:* `agent` needs to `have` the `hub` off `ground`.  
   *Effect:* `hub` is placed back on `ground`, and `agent` `have`s the `jack`.

10. **fetch**  
    *Precondition:* `object` is inside `container` and `container` is `open`.  
    *Effect:* `object` is held by `agent` and removed from `container`.

11. **put-away**  
    *Precondition:* `object` is held by `agent` and `container` is `open`.  
    *Effect:* `object` is placed back inside `container` and removed from `agent`.

### Summary of Actions:

1. **open**
2. **close**
3. **inflate**
4. **remove-wheel**
5. **put-on-wheel**
6. **do-up**
7. **undo**
8. **jack-up**
9. **jack-down**
10. **fetch**
11. **put-away**

### Explanation:

- **Actions 1 & 2** toggle the state of `container` between `unlocked` and `closed`.
- **Action 3** updates `intact tyre` to `inflated` as per the goal.
- **Actions 4 & 5** handle the removal and placement of `wheel` on `hub`.
- **Actions 6 & 7** manage the state of `nut` and `hub` to align with the goal conditions.
- **Actions 8 & 9** involve lifting and lowering the `hub` using `jack`.
- **Actions 10 & 11** ensure that `object` is correctly placed inside `container`, maintaining the integrity of the system.

By following this sequence, all goal conditions are satisfied while ensuring that the system's state transitions are optimal and consistent with the defined action preconditions and effects.
