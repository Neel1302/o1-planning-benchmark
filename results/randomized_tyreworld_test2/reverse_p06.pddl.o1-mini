To achieve your goal of replacing `flat tyre` with `intact tyre` on the `hub`, ensuring that `intact tyre` becomes `inflated`, and maintaining the desired state of other components, the following optimal sequence of actions should be executed. This plan accounts for the presence of **6 instances** of each relevant component.

## **Optimal Plan Sequence:**

1. **jack-up**  
   *Purpose*: **Lift** each `hub` off the `ground` using a `jack`. This makes each `hub` free for manipulation.  
   *Repetition*: Execute this action **6 times**, once for each `hub`.

2. **remove-wheel**  
   *Purpose*: **Remove** each `flat tyre` from the `hub`. After this action, each `flat tyre` will be in the `boot`.  
   *Repetition*: Execute this action **6 times**, once for each `flat tyre`.

3. **put-on-wheel**  
   *Purpose*: **Place** each `intact tyre` onto the now-free `hub`. This replaces each `flat tyre` with `intact tyre` on the `hub`.  
   *Repetition*: Execute this action **6 times**, once for each `intact tyre`.

4. **inflate**  
   *Purpose*: **Transform** each `intact tyre` into `inflated` using an `pump`. This satisfies the condition that `intact tyre` should be `inflated`.  
   *Repetition*: Execute this action **6 times**, once for each `intact tyre`.

5. **jack-down**  
   *Purpose*: **Lower** each `hub` back onto the `ground` using the `jack`. This finalizes the placement of `intact tyre` as `inflated` on the `hub`.  
   *Repetition*: Execute this action **6 times**, once for each `hub`.

## **Detailed Explanation of the Plan:**

1. **Lifting the `hub` (`jack-up`):**
   - **Preconditions**: 
     - The `agent` is **have**ing a `jack`.
     - Each `hub` is on the `ground`.
   - **Effects**:
     - Each `hub` is no longer on the `ground`.
     - The `agent` is no longer **have**ing the `jack`.
   - **Reasoning**: Lifting the `hub` frees it from the `ground`, allowing for the removal and placement of components without obstruction.

2. **Removing `flat tyre` (`remove-wheel`):**
   - **Preconditions**:
     - Each `hub` is not on the `ground`.
     - Each `flat tyre` is currently on a `hub`.
     - Each `hub` is not `fastened`.
   - **Effects**:
     - Each `flat tyre` is now **have**ed by the `agent` and placed in the `boot`.
     - Each `hub` becomes free.
   - **Reasoning**: Removing `flat tyre` clears space on each `hub` for the new component.

3. **Placing `intact tyre` (`put-on-wheel`):**
   - **Preconditions**:
     - The `agent` has each `intact tyre`.
     - Each `hub` is free.
     - Each `hub` is not `fastened`.
     - Each `hub` is not on the `ground`.
   - **Effects**:
     - Each `intact tyre` is placed on a `hub`.
     - Each `hub` is no longer free.
     - The `agent` no longer **have**s the `intact tyre`.
   - **Reasoning**: Placing `intact tyre` onto each `hub` prepares them for transformation.

4. **Transforming to `inflated` (`inflate`):**
   - **Preconditions**:
     - The `agent` has an `pump`.
     - Each `intact tyre` is not `inflated`.
     - Each `intact tyre` is `intact`.
   - **Effects**:
     - Each `intact tyre` becomes `inflated`.
   - **Reasoning**: This action finalizes the transformation of `intact tyre` into the desired state `inflated`.

5. **Lowering the `hub` (`jack-down`):**
   - **Preconditions**:
     - The `agent` is **have**ing the `hub` off the `ground`.
   - **Effects**:
     - Each `hub` is placed back on the `ground`.
     - The `agent` is **have**ing the `jack`.
   - **Reasoning**: Lowering the `hub` back onto the `ground` completes the placement of `inflated` in the desired location.

## **Summary:**

To accommodate the **6 instances** of each component (`hub`, `nut`, `flat tyre`, and `intact tyre`), each action in the plan must be executed **6 times**, once for each instance. This ensures that all components are correctly manipulated and placed according to the specified goal.

**Final Action Sequence (Executed 6 Times):**

1. `jack-up`
2. `remove-wheel`
3. `put-on-wheel`
4. `inflate`
5. `jack-down`

By following this sequence meticulously for each of the 6 instances, you will successfully achieve the desired state where `flat tyre` are replaced with `intact tyre` (now `inflated`) on each `hub`, all `nut` remain as `tight` on the `hub`, and all specified components are correctly placed in the `boot`, which is `closed`.
