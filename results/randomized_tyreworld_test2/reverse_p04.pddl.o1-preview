Certainly! Here's an optimal sequence of actions to achieve your goal:

1. **open**: Open the boot (storage unit).  
   *Preconditions*: The boot is unlocked (closed) and closed (locked).  
   *Effects*: The boot is now open (unlocked) and not closed (locked).

2. **fetch**: Retrieve the jack from the boot.  
   *Preconditions*: The jack is inside the boot, and the boot is open (unlocked).  
   *Effects*: The jack is now held by the agent (you) and not inside the boot.

3. **fetch**: Retrieve the pump from the boot.  
   *Preconditions & Effects*: Same as above for pump.

4. **fetch**: Retrieve the wrench from the boot.  
   *Preconditions & Effects*: Same as above for wrench.

5. **fetch**: Retrieve all intact tyre units from the boot.  
   *Preconditions & Effects*: Repeat for each intact tyre.

For each of the four hub units, perform the following steps:

6. **loosen**: Change the nut from tight to loose on the hub.  
   *Preconditions*: You have the wrench, the nut on the hub is tight, and the hub is on the ground.  
   *Effects*: The nut on the hub is now loose.

7. **jack-up**: Lift the hub off the ground using the jack.  
   *Preconditions*: You have (use) the jack, and the hub is on the ground.  
   *Effects*: The hub is no longer on the ground, and you no longer have the jack.

8. **undo**: Unlock the hub and remove the nut.  
   *Preconditions*: The hub is not on the ground, the hub is fastened (locked), you have the wrench, and the nut is loose.  
   *Effects*: You have the nut, and the hub is now not fastened (unlocked).

9. **remove-wheel**: Remove the flat tyre from the hub.  
   *Preconditions*: The hub is not on the ground, the flat tyre (wheel) is on the hub, and the hub is not fastened (unlocked).  
   *Effects*: You have (hold) the flat tyre, and the hub is now free (no tyre installed).

10. **inflate**: Configure the intact tyre using the pump.  
    *Preconditions*: You have the pump, the intact tyre is not inflated (configured), and it is intact.  
    *Effects*: The intact tyre is now inflated.

11. **put-on-wheel**: Install the intact tyre onto the hub.  
    *Preconditions*: You have the intact tyre, the hub is free, not fastened (unlocked), and not on the ground.  
    *Effects*: The intact tyre is now on the hub, and you no longer have the intact tyre.

12. **do-up**: Lock the hub and reinstall the nut.  
    *Preconditions*: You have the wrench, the hub is not fastened, not on the ground, and you have the nut.  
    *Effects*: The nut is loose on the hub, the hub is fastened (locked), and you no longer have the nut.

13. **jack-down**: Lower the hub back onto the ground using the jack.  
    *Preconditions*: You have the hub off the ground.  
    *Effects*: The hub is back on the ground, and you have the jack.

14. **tighten**: Reset the nut from loose back to tight on the hub.  
    *Preconditions*: You have the wrench, the nut on the hub is loose, and the hub is on the ground.  
    *Effects*: The nut on the hub is tight.

After all hub units have been processed:

15. **put-away**: Return all flat tyre units to the boot.  
    *Preconditions*: You have the flat tyre and the boot is open (unlocked).  
    *Effects*: The flat tyre are inside the boot, and you no longer have them.

16. **put-away**: Return the jack, pump, and wrench to the boot.  
    *Preconditions & Effects*: Repeat for each item.

17. **close**: Close the boot.  
    *Preconditions*: The boot is open (unlocked).  
    *Effects*: The boot is closed (locked) and not open.

This plan ensures that:

- The flat tyre are replaced with intact tyre on all hub units.
- The intact tyre are configured (inflated).
- The nut are tight on the hub units.
- The flat tyre, wrench, jack, and pump are returned to the boot.
- The boot is closed and closed.

This sequence minimizes the number of actions by efficiently retrieving and returning items and properly sequencing operations to prevent unnecessary steps.
