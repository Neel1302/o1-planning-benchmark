To solve the planning problem you described, we'll need to ensure all the preconditions for each action are satisfied before we execute them, aiming for an optimal sequence of actions to meet your goals. Here's how you can achieve that:

Start State:

The flat tyre are on the hub.
The hub are on the ground.
The nut are tight on the hub.
The intact tyre are not inflated.
The boot is closed.
jack, pump, wrench, and intact tyre are in the boot.
Goals:

Replace flat tyre with intact tyre on the hub.
Ensure intact tyre is inflated.
Maintain nut as tight on the hub.
All items (flat tyre, wrench, jack, pump) should be in the boot.
The boot should be closed.
Optimal Plan:

close action:

Precondition: container is open.
Effect: Makes container closed.
Apply this action to ensure boot maintains the state closed if needed.
remove-wheel action:

Precondition: hub is not on ground, wheel (here flat tyre) is currently on hub, and hub is not fastened.
Effect: Removes flat tyre from hub.
Apply this to each hub holding flat tyre.
put-on-wheel action:

Precondition: agent has wheel (here intact tyre), hub is free, hub is not fastened, hub is not on ground.
Effect: Places intact tyre on hub.
Execute after removing flat tyre and before adding intact tyre.
inflate action:

Precondition: agent has a pump, wheel (here intact tyre) is not inflated, wheel is intact.
Effect: Makes intact tyre inflated.
Execute after placing intact tyre on hub.
Return items to boot:

Ensure flat tyre, wrench, jack, pump are returned to boot.
No specific action defined for returning, assume manual return based on scenario context.
This sequence ensures that each step follows logically from the previous, maintaining the preconditions necessary for each subsequent action and leading to the fulfillment of all stated goals.
