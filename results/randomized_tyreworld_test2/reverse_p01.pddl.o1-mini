To achieve the goal of replacing **flat tyre** with **intact tyre** on the **hub**, ensuring that **intact tyre** becomes **inflated**, and maintaining the required states of other objects, the following optimal sequence of actions should be performed:

1. **loosen**
2. **jack-up**
3. **undo**
4. **remove-wheel**
5. **inflate**
6. **do-up**
7. **jack-down**
8. **tighten**

### Action Sequence Breakdown:

1. **loosen**
   - **Purpose:** Change **nut** on **hub** from **tight** to **loose**.
   - **Preconditions Met:** 
     - **agent** has **wrench**.
     - **nut** on **hub** is **tight**.
     - **hub** is on **ground**.

2. **jack-up**
   - **Purpose:** Lift **hub** off **ground** using **jack**.
   - **Preconditions Met:** 
     - **agent** is performing **have** on **jack**.
     - **hub** is on **ground**.

3. **undo**
   - **Purpose:** Set **hub** to not be **fastened**.
   - **Preconditions Met:** 
     - **hub** is not on **ground**.
     - **hub** is **fastened**.
     - **agent** has **wrench**.
     - **nut** is **loose**.

4. **remove-wheel**
   - **Purpose:** Remove **flat tyre** from **hub**.
   - **Preconditions Met:** 
     - **hub** is not on **ground**.
     - **flat tyre** is on **hub**.
     - **hub** is not **fastened**.

5. **inflate**
   - **Purpose:** Change **intact tyre** to **inflated** using **pump**.
   - **Preconditions Met:** 
     - **agent** has **pump**.
     - **intact tyre** is not **inflated**.
     - **intact tyre** is on **hub**.

6. **do-up**
   - **Purpose:** Restore **hub** to **fastened**.
   - **Preconditions Met:** 
     - **agent** has **wrench**.
     - **hub** is not **fastened**.
     - **hub** is not on **ground**.
     - **agent** has **nut** set to **fastened**.

7. **jack-down**
   - **Purpose:** Lower **hub** back to **ground** using **jack**.
   - **Preconditions Met:** 
     - **agent** is performing **have** on **hub** off **ground**.

8. **tighten**
   - **Purpose:** Change **nut** on **hub** back to **tight**.
   - **Preconditions Met:** 
     - **agent** has **wrench**.
     - **nut** on **hub** is **loose**.
     - **hub** is on **ground**.

### Summary of Effects:

- **flat tyre** is removed from **hub**.
- **intact tyre** is replaced and transformed into **inflated** on **hub**.
- **nut** is restored to **tight** on **hub**.
- All specified objects (**flat tyre**, **wrench**, **jack**, **pump**) are in the **boot**.
- **boot** remains **closed**.

This sequence ensures that all goal conditions are met efficiently while maintaining the integrity of the system's state.
