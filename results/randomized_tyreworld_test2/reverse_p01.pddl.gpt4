Given the problem and the set of actions defined, here's an optimal plan to achieve the stated goals:

"open" action: Execute the "open" action to set the state of container to open, making it no longer closed. This step is necessary to meet the preconditions for other actions that require container to be open.

"jack-up" action: Execute the "jack-up" action to lift hub off ground using jack. This action requires agent to manipulate jack, and after completion, hub will no longer be on ground.

"jack-down" action: Execute the "jack-down" action to lower hub back onto ground. This action involves using jack to place hub back on ground, meeting certain conditions for subsequent actions.

"tighten" action: If necessary, execute the "tighten" action to set nut on hub to tight. This step ensures that the state of nut on hub matches the goal.

"remove-wheel" action: Execute the "remove-wheel" action to remove flat tyre from hub. This action involves agent manipulating the item, making hub free from flat tyre.

"put-on-wheel" action: Execute the "put-on-wheel" action to place intact tyre on hub. This step is necessary to put the new item in place on hub.

"inflate" action: Execute the "inflate" action to inflate intact tyre using pump. This action changes the state of intact tyre to inflated, aligning it with the goal.

"close" action: Finally, execute the "close" action to change the state of container back to closed. This ensures that the final condition of boot being closed is met.

This plan is optimal in that it aims to minimize the number of steps and ensures that all conditions and goals are met using the available actions. Each step sequentially builds upon the state changes required to reach the final goal states for each of the items involved.
