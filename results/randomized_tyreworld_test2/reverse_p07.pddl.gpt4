To achieve the goals set out in your planning problem, I will outline the sequence of actions needed according to the actions and their preconditions/effects that you provided. Here's a step-by-step plan to reach the desired state:

1. **close Action**: The current state of `container` is `unlocked` and `closed`. Since the precondition for the `close` action is that the `container` is `open`, we need to ensure this state. Assuming from the context that `container` can transition from `unlocked` to `open`:
   - Execute `close` action to make `container` `closed` and `not open`.

2. **jack-up Action**: Since the `boot` is `closed`, you need to remove `hub` from `ground` to manipulate the items on it:
   - Execute `jack-up` to lift `hub` off `ground` using `jack`, setting the `hub` to not be on `ground`.

3. **remove-wheel Action**: To remove `flat tyre` from `hub`, assuming `flat tyre` is `wheel` and `hub` is free and not `fastened`:
   - Execute `remove-wheel` to remove `flat tyre` from `hub`.

4. **put-on-wheel Action**: To place `intact tyre` onto `hub`, assuming `intact tyre` is `wheel` and it is held by `agent`:
   - Execute `put-on-wheel` to place `intact tyre` on `hub`.

5. **inflate Action**: Since `intact tyre` should be `inflated`, and it is `wheel`:
   - Execute `inflate` to set `intact tyre` as `inflated`.

6. **jack-down Action**: To restore `hub` back on `ground`:
   - Execute `jack-down` to lower `hub` back to `ground`.

7. **loosen and tighten Actions**: To ensure `nut` is `tight` on `hub`, if itâ€™s not already in this state:
   - Execute `loosen` if `nut` is not `tight` to make it `loose`, and then `tighten` to revert it back to `tight`.

8. **open Action**: Finally, to revert the state of `container` back to a suitable form if necessary:
   - Execute `open` if you need to set `container` back from `closed` to `open`.

This plan assumes the availability of certain transitions between states that might need additional actions or conditions not specified in your original list. It also assumes that actions can be performed sequentially as needed, without interference. This optimal plan seeks to achieve the goals you specified by only using the necessary actions to alter the states as required.
