The optimal sequence of actions would be as follows:

1. Create a block at the depot.
2. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-2-0.
3. Place a block at pos-2-0.
4. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-0.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 three more times in order to build a height of 4 at pos-2-0.
6. Create a block at the depot
7. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-3-0.
8. Place a block at pos-3-0.
9. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-1-0.
10. Repeat steps 6-9 two more times in order to build a height of 3 at pos-3-0.
11. Create a block at the depot.
12. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-3-1 through pos-3-0.
13. Place a block at pos-3-1.
14. Move from pos-3-1 to pos-1-0 through pos-3-0.
15. Repeat steps 11-14 two more times in order to build a height of 3 at pos-3-1.
16. Create a block at the depot.
17. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-3-2 through pos-3-0 and pos-3-1.
18. Place a block at pos-3-2.
19. Move from pos-3-2 to pos-1-0 through pos-3-1 and pos-3-0.
20. Repeat steps 16-19 three more times in order to build a height of 4 at pos-3-2.

The robot has now achieved its goal and does not have any unused blocks.
