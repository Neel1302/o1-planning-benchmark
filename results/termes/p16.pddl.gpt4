Assuming the initial height of all positions is 0, here is an efficient plan:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
2. Move to pos-1-1.
3. Place a block at pos-1-2.
4. Move back to pos-1-0.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 four more times. Now, the height at pos-1-2 will be 5.

6. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
7. Move to pos-2-0.
8. Place a block at pos-2-0.
9. Return to pos-1-0 and repeat steps 6-9 once. Now, the height at pos-2-0 will be 2.

10. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
11. Move to pos-1-1.
12. Move to pos-1-2.
13. Move to pos-2-2.
14. Move to pos-3-2.
15. Place a block at pos-3-1.
16. Return to pos-1-0 through same route and repeat steps 10-16 four more times. Now, the height at pos-3-1 will be 5.

17. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
18. Move to pos-1-1.
19. Move to pos-1-2.
20. Move to pos-2-2.
21. Move to pos-3-2.
22. Place a block at pos-3-2.
23. Return to pos-1-0 and repeat steps 17-23 three more times. Now, the height at pos-3-2 will be 4.

Now you have achieved the goal. The robot is back at the depot with no unplaced blocks and the required positions have the desired heights.
