To solve this problem optimally, we need to build two towers of height 5 at positions `pos-1-2` and `pos-3-2`, starting from the depot at `pos-2-0`. We must also ensure that the robot does not have an unplaced block at the end. Given that the robot can only carry one block at a time and can only move to adjacent positions with certain height constraints, we'll need to carefully plan the sequence of actions.

Here's an optimal plan:

**Overview:**

- Build ramps to both target positions by increasing the heights of positions along the paths.
- Deliver blocks to the towers by moving along these ramps.
- Ensure that the robot can always move between positions by maintaining allowable height differences.

**Detailed Plan:**

**1. Build Ramps to `pos-1-2` and `pos-3-2`:**

We need to build ramps to both towers to allow the robot to move up to the increasing heights of the towers. We'll build up the heights of positions along the paths to the towers.

**For `pos-1-2`:**

- **Step 1:** Create a block at the depot (`pos-2-0`). Robot now has a block.
- **Step 2:** Move north to `pos-1-0` (height 0).
- **Step 3:** Place the block at `pos-1-1`, increasing its height to 1.
- **Step 4:** Return south to `pos-2-0`.

- **Step 5:** Create another block at the depot.
- **Step 6:** Move north to `pos-1-0` (height 0).
- **Step 7:** Move east and up to `pos-1-1` (height 1).
- **Step 8:** Place the block at `pos-1-2` (height 0), increasing its height to 1.
- **Step 9:** Return west and down to `pos-1-0` (height 0), then south to `pos-2-0`.

Repeat the above steps, incrementally increasing the heights of `pos-1-1` and `pos-1-2` to build the ramp and the tower:

- Increase `pos-1-1` to height 2.
- Increase `pos-1-2` to heights 2, 3, 4, and finally 5.

**For `pos-3-2`:**

- **Step 1:** Create a block at the depot.
- **Step 2:** Move south to `pos-3-0` (height 0).
- **Step 3:** Place the block at `pos-3-1`, increasing its height to 1.
- **Step 4:** Return north to `pos-2-0`.

- **Step 5:** Create another block at the depot.
- **Step 6:** Move south to `pos-3-0` (height 0).
- **Step 7:** Move east and up to `pos-3-1` (height 1).
- **Step 8:** Place the block at `pos-3-2` (height 0), increasing its height to 1.
- **Step 9:** Return west and down to `pos-3-0`, then north to `pos-2-0`.

Repeat the above steps, incrementally increasing the heights of `pos-3-1` and `pos-3-2` to build the ramp and the tower:

- Increase `pos-3-1` to height 2.
- Increase `pos-3-2` to heights 2, 3, 4, and finally 5.

**2. Sequence of Actions:**

**Building the Ramp and Tower at `pos-1-2`:**

1. **Create Block:** At `pos-2-0`.
2. **Move:** North to `pos-1-0`.
3. **Place Block:** At `pos-1-1` (height 0 → 1).
4. **Return:** South to `pos-2-0`.
5. **Create Block:** At `pos-2-0`.
6. **Move:** North to `pos-1-0`.
7. **Move Up:** East to `pos-1-1` (height 1).
8. **Place Block:** At `pos-1-2` (height 0 → 1).
9. **Return:** West and down to `pos-1-0`, then south to `pos-2-0`.
10. **Create Block:** At `pos-2-0`.
11. **Move:** North to `pos-1-0`.
12. **Place Block:** At `pos-1-1` (height 1 → 2).
13. **Return:** South to `pos-2-0`.
14. **Create Block:** At `pos-2-0`.
15. **Move:** North to `pos-1-0`.
16. **Move Up:** East to `pos-1-1` (height 2).
17. **Move Up:** East to `pos-1-2` (height 1).
18. **Place Block:** At `pos-1-2` (height 1 → 2).
19. **Return:** West and down to `pos-1-1`, then down and west to `pos-1-0`, then south to `pos-2-0`.
20. **Repeat Steps 10-19,** incrementally increasing the heights until `pos-1-2` reaches height 5.

**Building the Ramp and Tower at `pos-3-2`:**

Follow similar steps as above, moving south instead of north, and adjusting directions accordingly.

**3. Final Steps:**

- Ensure the robot does not have any blocks and is positioned back at `pos-2-0` or any other position, with no unplaced blocks remaining.

**Summary:**

- Total Blocks Created: 16 (5 for each tower, 3 for each ramp).
- The robot builds ramps to both towers by increasing the heights of intermediate positions.
- The robot moves according to the allowed movements, respecting height differences.
- No blocks are left unplaced at the end.

By carefully building ramps and delivering blocks, we ensure that the robot can reach the towers even as their heights increase, and we minimize the total number of actions required to achieve the goal.
