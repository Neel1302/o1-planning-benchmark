1. Create a block at pos-1-0 (the depot).
2. Move from the depot to pos-2-0.
3. Place the block at pos-2-0.
4. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-0 (the depot).
5. Repeat steps 1-4 two more times to achieve the desired height of 3 at pos-2-0.
6. After building up pos-2-0, move from pos-1-0 (the depot) back to pos-2-0.
7. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
8. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-3-1.
9. Move from pos-3-1 to pos-3-2.
10. Move from pos-3-2 back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
11. Create a block at pos-1-0 (the depot).
12. Move from the depot to pos-2-0.
13. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
14. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-3-1.
15. Move from pos-3-1 to pos-3-2.
16. Place the block at pos-3-2.
17. Repeat steps 10-16 three more times to achieve the desired height of 4 at pos-3-2.

These sets of actions will ensure that pos-2-0 has a height of 3, and pos-3-2 has a height of 4, which is the desired outcome. At the end there are no unplaced blocks as required.
