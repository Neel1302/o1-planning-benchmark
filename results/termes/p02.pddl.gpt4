Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "Create a block at the depot"
2. "Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1"
3. "Place a block at pos-2-1"
4. "Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0"
5. "Create a block at the depot"
6. "Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1"
7. "Place a block at pos-2-1"
8. "Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0"
9. "Create a block at the depot"
10. "Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1"
11. "Place a block at pos-2-1"
12. "Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0"
13. "Create a block at the depot"
14. "Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0"
15. "Place a block at pos-3-0"
16. "Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0"
17. "Create a block at the depot"
18. "Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0"
19. "Place a block at pos-3-0"
20. "Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0"
21. "Create a block at the depot"
22. "Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0"
23. "Place a block at pos-3-0"

And done! The robot is back in its initial position and the blocks are built as the goal states.
