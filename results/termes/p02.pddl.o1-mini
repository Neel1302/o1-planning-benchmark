Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to achieve the goal of building blocks so that the height at `pos-2-1` and `pos-3-0` is **3** each. The plan ensures that there are no unplaced blocks at the end.

### **Overview of the Plan**

1. **Objective:** 
   - Build `pos-2-1` to height **3**.
   - Build `pos-3-0` to height **3**.
   
2. **Constraints:**
   - Maximum block height: **3**.
   - Depot is at `pos-2-0`.
   - Robot starts at the depot (`pos-2-0`).
   - Each block must be created, transported, and placed individually.
   - No unplaced blocks should remain at the end.

3. **Assumptions:**
   - The grid follows standard adjacency rules (up, down, left, right).
   - The robot can carry **one block** at a time.

### **Detailed Step-by-Step Plan**

#### **Phase 1: Building `pos-2-1` to Height 3**

For each of the **3 blocks** required at `pos-2-1`:

1. **Create a Block at Depot:**
   - **Action:** `Create a block at pos-2-0`.
   - **Outcome:** Robot now holds one block.

2. **Move to `pos-2-1`:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-1`.
   - **Path:** From `pos-2-0` → `pos-2-1`.
   - **Outcome:** Robot is now at `pos-2-1` carrying one block.

3. **Place the Block:**
   - **Action:** `Place a block at pos-2-1`.
   - **Outcome:** Height at `pos-2-1` increases by one. Robot no longer holds a block.

4. **Return to Depot:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-0`.
   - **Path:** From `pos-2-1` → `pos-2-0`.
   - **Outcome:** Robot is back at the depot, ready for the next block.

**Repeat Steps 1-4 Two More Times** to achieve a total height of **3** at `pos-2-1`.

#### **Phase 2: Building `pos-3-0` to Height 3**

For each of the **3 blocks** required at `pos-3-0`:

1. **Create a Block at Depot:**
   - **Action:** `Create a block at pos-2-0`.
   - **Outcome:** Robot now holds one block.

2. **Move to `pos-3-0`:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-3-0`.
   - **Path:** From `pos-2-0` → `pos-3-0`.
   - **Outcome:** Robot is now at `pos-3-0` carrying one block.

3. **Place the Block:**
   - **Action:** `Place a block at pos-3-0`.
   - **Outcome:** Height at `pos-3-0` increases by one. Robot no longer holds a block.

4. **Return to Depot:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-0`.
   - **Path:** From `pos-3-0` → `pos-2-0`.
   - **Outcome:** Robot is back at the depot, ready for the next block.

**Repeat Steps 1-4 Two More Times** to achieve a total height of **3** at `pos-3-0`.

### **Complete Sequence of Actions**

Here is the **ordered list of actions** to accomplish the task:

1. **Create Block 1 at Depot:**
   - `Create a block at pos-2-0`

2. **Move to `pos-2-1`:**
   - `Move to pos-2-1`

3. **Place Block 1 at `pos-2-1`:**
   - `Place a block at pos-2-1`

4. **Return to Depot:**
   - `Move to pos-2-0`

5. **Create Block 2 at Depot:**
   - `Create a block at pos-2-0`

6. **Move to `pos-2-1`:**
   - `Move to pos-2-1`

7. **Place Block 2 at `pos-2-1`:**
   - `Place a block at pos-2-1`

8. **Return to Depot:**
   - `Move to pos-2-0`

9. **Create Block 3 at Depot:**
   - `Create a block at pos-2-0`

10. **Move to `pos-2-1`:**
    - `Move to pos-2-1`

11. **Place Block 3 at `pos-2-1`:**
    - `Place a block at pos-2-1`

12. **Return to Depot:**
    - `Move to pos-2-0`

13. **Create Block 4 at Depot:**
    - `Create a block at pos-2-0`

14. **Move to `pos-3-0`:**
    - `Move to pos-3-0`

15. **Place Block 4 at `pos-3-0`:**
    - `Place a block at pos-3-0`

16. **Return to Depot:**
    - `Move to pos-2-0`

17. **Create Block 5 at Depot:**
    - `Create a block at pos-2-0`

18. **Move to `pos-3-0`:**
    - `Move to pos-3-0`

19. **Place Block 5 at `pos-3-0`:**
    - `Place a block at pos-3-0`

20. **Return to Depot:**
    - `Move to pos-2-0`

21. **Create Block 6 at Depot:**
    - `Create a block at pos-2-0`

22. **Move to `pos-3-0`:**
    - `Move to pos-3-0`

23. **Place Block 6 at `pos-3-0`:**
    - `Place a block at pos-3-0`

24. **Return to Depot:**
    - `Move to pos-2-0`

### **Summary**

- **Total Blocks Created:** 6
- **Total Moves:**
  - Depot ↔ `pos-2-1`: 6 moves
  - Depot ↔ `pos-3-0`: 6 moves
- **Total Placements:** 6

This sequence ensures that both `pos-2-1` and `pos-3-0` reach the desired height of **3**, and all blocks are properly placed with no unplaced blocks remaining.
