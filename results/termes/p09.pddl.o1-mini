Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** for the robot to build the desired structure at `pos-0-3` with a height of 4. The plan ensures that all actions are efficiently sequenced, and no blocks remain unplaced at the end.

### **Plan Overview:**
To achieve the goal, the robot will:
1. **Create a block** at the depot (`pos-2-0`).
2. **Transport the block** to a neighboring position adjacent to `pos-0-3`.
3. **Place the block** on `pos-0-3`.
4. **Return to the depot** to repeat the process until four blocks are placed.

### **Detailed Step-by-Step Actions:**
**This sequence will be repeated **4 times** to place four blocks on `pos-0-3`.**

1. **Create a Block at Depot:**
   - **Action:** `Create block at depot`
   - **Result:** Robot now **has one block**.

2. **Move from Depot to pos-1-0:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-1-0`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-1-0`.

3. **Move from pos-1-0 to pos-0-0:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-0-0`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-0-0`.

4. **Move from pos-0-0 to pos-0-1:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-0-1`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-0-1`.

5. **Move from pos-0-1 to pos-0-2:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-0-2`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-0-2`.

6. **Place Block on pos-0-3:**
   - **Action:** `Place block at pos-0-3`
   - **Result:** `pos-0-3` height increases by 1 (current height: 1 to 4 after 4 iterations). Robot **no longer has a block**.

7. **Move Back from pos-0-2 to pos-0-1:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-0-1`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-0-1`.

8. **Move Back from pos-0-1 to pos-0-0:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-0-0`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-0-0`.

9. **Move Back from pos-0-0 to pos-1-0:**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-1-0`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-1-0`.

10. **Move Back from pos-1-0 to Depot (pos-2-0):**
    - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-0`
    - **Result:** Robot is back at the depot.

### **Complete Sequence for Each Block:**
```
1. Create block at depot
2. Move to pos-1-0
3. Move to pos-0-0
4. Move to pos-0-1
5. Move to pos-0-2
6. Place block at pos-0-3
7. Move to pos-0-1
8. Move to pos-0-0
9. Move to pos-1-0
10. Move to pos-2-0
```

### **Final Notes:**
- **Repeat the above 10-step sequence four times** to place all four blocks on `pos-0-3`.
- **After the fourth iteration**, `pos-0-3` will reach the desired height of 4.
- **No blocks remain unplaced**, as each created block is placed on `pos-0-3`.

### **Summary:**
By systematically creating, transporting, and placing each block, the robot efficiently builds the structure at `pos-0-3` while adhering to all constraints. This plan ensures optimal action usage with minimal backtracking.
