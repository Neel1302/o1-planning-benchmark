Certainly! To achieve the goal of building a stack of height 4 at `pos-3-1` optimally, we'll follow a structured sequence of actions. Here's the step-by-step plan:

### **Action Sequence:**

1. **Create Block at Depot**
   - **Action:** `Create block at depot`
   - **Description:** The robot creates the first block and holds it.

2. **Move to pos-2-1**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-1`
   - **Description:** The robot moves from the depot (`pos-2-0`) to the neighboring position `pos-2-1`.

3. **Place Block at pos-3-1**
   - **Action:** `Place block at pos-3-1`
   - **Description:** The robot places the first block at `pos-3-1`, increasing its height to 1.

4. **Move Back to Depot**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-0`
   - **Description:** The robot returns to the depot to create the next block.

5. **Create Block at Depot**
   - **Action:** `Create block at depot`
   - **Description:** The robot creates the second block and holds it.

6. **Move to pos-2-1**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-1`
   - **Description:** The robot moves again to `pos-2-1`.

7. **Place Block at pos-3-1**
   - **Action:** `Place block at pos-3-1`
   - **Description:** The robot places the second block at `pos-3-1`, increasing its height to 2.

8. **Move Back to Depot**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-0`
   - **Description:** The robot returns to the depot to create the third block.

9. **Create Block at Depot**
   - **Action:** `Create block at depot`
   - **Description:** The robot creates the third block and holds it.

10. **Move to pos-2-1**
    - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-1`
    - **Description:** The robot moves to `pos-2-1`.

11. **Place Block at pos-3-1**
    - **Action:** `Place block at pos-3-1`
    - **Description:** The robot places the third block at `pos-3-1`, increasing its height to 3.

12. **Move Back to Depot**
    - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-0`
    - **Description:** The robot returns to the depot to create the fourth block.

13. **Create Block at Depot**
    - **Action:** `Create block at depot`
    - **Description:** The robot creates the fourth block and holds it.

14. **Move to pos-2-1**
    - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-1`
    - **Description:** The robot moves to `pos-2-1`.

15. **Place Block at pos-3-1**
    - **Action:** `Place block at pos-3-1`
    - **Description:** The robot places the fourth block at `pos-3-1`, achieving the desired height of 4.

16. **Move Back to Depot**
    - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-0`
    - **Description:** The robot returns to the depot to ensure no blocks are left unplaced.

### **Summary of Actions:**

1. Create block at depot
2. Move to pos-2-1
3. Place block at pos-3-1
4. Move to pos-2-0
5. Create block at depot
6. Move to pos-2-1
7. Place block at pos-3-1
8. Move to pos-2-0
9. Create block at depot
10. Move to pos-2-1
11. Place block at pos-3-1
12. Move to pos-2-0
13. Create block at depot
14. Move to pos-2-1
15. Place block at pos-3-1
16. Move to pos-2-0

### **Explanation:**

- **Block Creation:** The robot creates a new block at the depot each time it needs to place one, ensuring it always has a block to use.
  
- **Movement:** The robot alternates between moving to `pos-2-1` to place the block and returning to the depot to create the next block. This ensures efficiency by minimizing unnecessary movements.
  
- **Placement:** Each `Place block at pos-3-1` action incrementally builds the stack, ensuring that the robot's current position height matches the target position's height before placing the block.
  
- **Final Position:** After placing the fourth block, the robot returns to the depot to ensure no blocks are left unplaced, satisfying the problem's constraints.

This sequence ensures that the robot efficiently builds the stack at `pos-3-1` to the required height of 4 while adhering to all constraints.
