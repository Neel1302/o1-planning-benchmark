An optimal plan of sequence of behaviors can be as follows:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0)
2. Move to pos-2-1 with block
3. Move to pos-2-2 with block
4. Move to pos-1-2 with block
5. Move to pos-0-2 with block
6. Place block at pos-0-2 (Height at pos-0-2: 1)
7. Move to pos-1-2 (empty)
8. Move to pos-2-2 (empty)
9. Move to pos-2-1 (empty)
10. Move to pos-2-0, which is the depot (empty)
11. Repeat steps 1-10 two more times to build height at pos-0-2 to 3 
12. After achieving height 3 at pos-0-2, move to pos-1-2
13. Move to pos-1-1
14. Repeat steps 1-13 three times but in step 6, place block at pos-1-1 and in the steps 12-13, move back to pos-1-1 to build height at pos-1-1 to 3

This is an optimal plan by which the goal is achieved by moving the minimum number of blocks and switching the minimum number of times between block pick-ups and block placements.
