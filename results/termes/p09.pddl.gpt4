Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a Block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move right to pos-2-1.
3. Place the block at pos-2-1.
4. Move left to depot (pos-2-0).
5. Repeat Steps 1 to 4 three more times, building up a tower of 4 blocks at pos-2-1.

Then,

6. Move right and up to pos-2-1 at height 1.
7. Move right to pos-2-2 at height 1.
8. Move right to pos-2-3 at height 1.
9. Move up to pos-2-3 at height 2.
10. Move up to pos-2-3 at height 3.
11. Move up and right to pos-0-3 at height 4.

Now, Transfer the blocks from pos-2-1 to pos-0-3:

12. Move down and left from pos-0-3 to pos-2-3 at height 3.
13. Move left from pos-2-3 to pos-2-2 at height 3.
14. Move left from pos-2-2 to pos-2-1 at height 3.
15. Move down and left to remove a block from pos-2-1 and arrive at depot (pos-2-0).
16. Move right and up to pos-2-1 at height 1.
17. Move right to pos-2-2 at height 1.
18. Move right to pos-2-3 at height 1.
19. Move up to pos-2-3 at height 2.
20. Move up to pos-2-3 at height 3.
21. Move up to pos-0-3 at height 4 and place a block.

Repeat steps 12 to 21 three more times to get a tower of 4 blocks at pos-0-3. The total number of moves is 88. This plan assumes that the robot can carry at most one block at a time and does not leave any unplaced block at the end.
