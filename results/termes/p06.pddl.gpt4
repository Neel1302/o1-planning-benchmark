Sure, from the start position 'pos-2-0', the optimal plan would look something like this (considering the number of movements should be minimal):

1. Create a block at the depot ('pos-2-0').
2. Move to 'pos-2-1'.
3. Move to 'pos-2-2'.
4. Move up to 'pos-1-2' and place the block there.
5. Move down to 'pos-2-2'.
6. Move to 'pos-2-1'.
7. Move to 'pos-2-0'.
8. Repeat steps 1-7, four more times. After this, the height at 'pos-1-2' will reach 5.
9. Once again, create a block at the depot ('pos-2-0').
10. Move to 'pos-2-1'.
11. Move to 'pos-2-2'.
12. Move to 'pos-3-2' and place the block.
13. Move to 'pos-2-2'.
14. Move to 'pos-2-1'.
15. Move to 'pos-2-0'.
16. Repeat steps 9-15, four more times. After this, the height at 'pos-3-2' will also reach 5.

In the end, following these steps, there is no unplaced block at the end and the desired heights '5' at positions 'pos-1-2' and 'pos-3-2' are achieved too.
