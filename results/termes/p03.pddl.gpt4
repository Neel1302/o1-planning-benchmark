Yes, I can provide a solution to this planning problem. The solution involves moving the robot to create blocks at the required location.

Here is an optimal plan:

Step 1: Create a block at the depot.
Step 2: Place the block at pos-3-0.
Step 3: Create a block at the depot.
Step 4: Place the block at pos-3-0.
Step 5: Create a block at the depot.
Step 6: Place the block at pos-3-0.
Step 7: Create a block at the depot.
Step 8: Move to pos-3-0.
Step 9: Move up to pos-3-1.
Step 10: Place the block at pos-3-1.
Step 11: Move down to pos-3-0.
Step 12: Move to pos-2-0.
Step 13: Create a block at the depot.
Step 14: Place the block at pos-3-0.
Step 15: Create a block at the depot.
Step 16: Move to pos-3-0.
Step 17: Move up to pos-3-1.
Step 18: Place the block at pos-3-1.
Step 19: Move down to pos-3-0.
Step 20: Move to pos-2-0.
Step 21: Create a block at the depot.
Step 22: Move to pos-3-0.
Step 23: Move up twice to pos-3-1.
Step 24: Place the block at pos-3-1.
Step 25: Move down twice to pos-2-0.
Step 26: Create a block at depot.
Step 27: Move to pos-3-0.
Step 28: Move up three times to pos-3-1.
Step 29: Place the block at pos-3-1.

By taking these steps, you would have successfully built blocks so that the height at pos-3-1 is 4.
