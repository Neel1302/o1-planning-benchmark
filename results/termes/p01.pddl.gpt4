Sure. Here is your optimal plan to reach the goal:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move to pos-2-1.
3. Place the block at pos-2-1.
4. Move back to the depot (pos-2-0).
5. Create a block at the depot.
6. Move to pos-2-1.
7. Move up to pos-2-1 (now at height 1).
8. Place the block at pos-2-1 (now at height 2).
9. Move down to pos-2-1 (now at height 1).
10. Move to the depot (pos-2-0).
11. Create a block at the depot.
12. Move to pos-2-1.
13. Move up twice to reach pos-2-1 (now at height 3).
14. Place the block at pos-2-1 (now at height 3, still maximum height).
15. Move down three times to reach the ground level at pos-2-1.
16. Move to pos-1-2.
17. Move up three times to reach pos-1-2 (now at height 3, leveling with the block at pos-2-1).
18. Move back to pos-2-1 (at height 3).
19. Remove the block from pos-2-1.
20. Move to pos-1-2.
21. Place the block at pos-1-2 (now at height 3 which is the goal). 

Now All actions are done and no unplaced blocks are left. The goal of height at pos-1-2 being 3 has been achieved.
