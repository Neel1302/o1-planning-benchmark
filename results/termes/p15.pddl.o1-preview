To solve this planning problem optimally, we need to optimize the robot's movements and actions to achieve the required block heights at the specified positions, while minimizing the total number of actions taken.

**Problem Summary:**
- Grid Size: 4 rows x 3 columns.
- Robot Start Position: `pos-2-0` (which is also the depot).
- Maximum Block Height: 5.
- Goals:
  - `pos-0-2`: Height 5.
  - `pos-3-0`: Height 3.
  - `pos-3-2`: Height 2.
- Constraints:
  - The robot can carry at most one block.
  - Cannot have an unplaced block at the end.
  - Blocks can only be created or destroyed at the depot.
  - Moving, placing, and removing blocks require the heights and specific conditions to be satisfied.

**Optimal Plan:**

1. **Build Height 3 at `pos-3-0`:**
   - **First Block:**
     1. **Create Block** at the depot (`pos-2-0`).
     2. **Move South** to `pos-3-0`.
     3. **Place Block** at `pos-3-0` (height becomes 1).
   - **Second Block:**
     4. **Move North** back to the depot (`pos-2-0`).
     5. **Create Block** at the depot.
     6. **Move South** to `pos-3-0`.
     7. **Place Block** at `pos-3-0` (height becomes 2).
   - **Third Block:**
     8. **Move North** back to the depot (`pos-2-0`).
     9. **Create Block** at the depot.
     10. **Move South** to `pos-3-0`.
     11. **Place Block** at `pos-3-0` (height becomes 3).

2. **Build Height 2 at `pos-3-2`:**
   - **First Block:**
     12. **Move East** to `pos-3-1`.
     13. **Move East** to `pos-3-2`.
     14. **Move North** to `pos-2-2`.
     15. **Move West** to `pos-2-1`.
     16. **Move West** to the depot (`pos-2-0`).
     17. **Create Block** at the depot.
     18. **Move East** to `pos-2-1`.
     19. **Move East** to `pos-2-2`.
     20. **Move South** to `pos-3-2`.
     21. **Place Block** at `pos-3-2` (height becomes 1).
   - **Second Block:**
     22. **Move North** to `pos-2-2`.
     23. **Move West** to `pos-2-1`.
     24. **Move West** to the depot (`pos-2-0`).
     25. **Create Block** at the depot.
     26. **Move East** to `pos-2-1`.
     27. **Move East** to `pos-2-2`.
     28. **Move South** to `pos-3-2`.
     29. **Place Block** at `pos-3-2` (height becomes 2).

3. **Build Height 5 at `pos-0-2`:**
   - **First Block:**
     30. **Move North** to `pos-1-0`.
     31. **Move North** to `pos-0-0`.
     32. **Move East** to `pos-0-1`.
     33. **Create Block** at the depot (`pos-2-0`).
     34. **Move East** to `pos-0-2`.
     35. **Place Block** at `pos-0-2` (height becomes 1).
   - **Second Block:**
     36. **Move West** to `pos-0-1`.
     37. **Move West** to `pos-0-0`.
     38. **Move South** to `pos-1-0`.
     39. **Move South** to the depot (`pos-2-0`).
     40. **Create Block** at the depot.
     41. **Move North** to `pos-1-0`.
     42. **Move North** to `pos-0-0`.
     43. **Move East** to `pos-0-1`.
     44. **Move East** to `pos-0-2`.
     45. **Place Block** at `pos-0-2` (height becomes 2).
   - **Third Block:**
     46. **Repeat Steps 36-45** (height at `pos-0-2` becomes 3).
   - **Fourth Block:**
     47. **Repeat Steps 36-45** (height at `pos-0-2` becomes 4).
   - **Fifth Block:**
     48. **Repeat Steps 36-45** (height at `pos-0-2` becomes 5).

**Summary of Actions:**
- Total **Create Block (CB)** actions: 10.
- Total **Place Block (P)** actions: 10.
- Total **Move (M)** actions: Calculated based on the steps, minimized by optimizing the path.

**Key Points:**
- The robot always carries a block when moving from the depot to the target position to avoid unnecessary trips.
- While the robot cannot carry more than one block, careful planning ensures it doesn't return empty-handed.
- By tackling positions closest to the depot first (like `pos-3-0`), we reduce the overall movement required.
- The robot ensures it doesn't have an unplaced block at the end by planning its movements and actions accordingly.

This plan is optimal because it minimizes the number of actions by efficiently using moves and aligning block placements with the robot's location and capacity constraints.
