Yes, here is an optimal plan to achieve the goal:

**Step 1: Build at `pos-2-0` (height 3)**

1. **Create Block at Depot**:
   - At `pos-1-0` (depot), the robot creates a block.

2. **Place First Block at `pos-2-0`**:
   - From `pos-1-0`, the robot places the block at `pos-2-0`.
     - Conditions are met since the heights at `pos-1-0` and `pos-2-0` are both 0, and they are adjacent.
   - `pos-2-0` height increases to 1.

3. **Move to `pos-2-0`**:
   - The robot moves from `pos-1-0` to `pos-2-0` (south).
     - Allowed since moving to a position with the same height (both heights are 0 after placement).

4. **Return to Depot**:
   - The robot returns to `pos-1-0` (north) without a block.

5. **Create Second Block**:
   - At the depot, the robot creates another block.

6. **Move to `pos-2-0`**:
   - The robot moves from `pos-1-0` to `pos-2-0` (south).
     - Now, `pos-2-0` has height 1.

7. **Place Second Block at `pos-2-0`**:
   - From `pos-1-0`, the robot cannot place another block at `pos-2-0` because the heights differ.
   - However, from `pos-2-0` itself, the robot can't place a block at its own position.
   - **Solution**: Increase the height at an adjacent position to match.
     - The robot moves to `pos-2-1` (east of `pos-2-0`).
       - From `pos-2-0` (height 1) to `pos-2-1` (height 0), moving down is allowed.
   - The robot cannot create blocks at positions other than the depot, so it must return to the depot.

8. **Return to Depot and Bring Block**:
   - Move back to `pos-1-0`, create another block, then move to `pos-2-1`.

9. **Place Block at `pos-2-1`**:
   - From `pos-1-0` (height 0) to `pos-2-1` (height 0), move and place the block at `pos-2-1`.
     - `pos-2-1` height increases to 1.

10. **Now Heights Match**:
    - The robot is at `pos-2-1` (height 1), adjacent to `pos-2-0` (height 1).
    - The robot can place the next block at `pos-2-0` from `pos-2-1`.

11. **Place Third Block at `pos-2-0`**:
    - Create a block, move to `pos-2-1`.
    - From `pos-2-1`, place the block at `pos-2-0`.
      - Now, `pos-2-0` height increases to 2.

12. **Repeat for Height 3**:
    - Increase the height at another adjacent position (e.g., `pos-2-2`) to 2.
    - The robot can then place the final block to reach height 3 at `pos-2-0`.

**Step 2: Build at `pos-3-2` (height 4)**

1. **Create Block at Depot**:
   - Return to depot (`pos-1-0`), create a block.

2. **Move to Adjacent Position**:
   - Move to `pos-1-2` via `pos-1-1`.
   - Move down to `pos-2-2`.

3. **Place Blocks at Adjacent Positions**:
   - Similar to building at `pos-2-0`, incrementally increase heights at adjacent positions (`pos-2-2`, `pos-3-1`) to facilitate placing blocks at `pos-3-2`.
   - Ensure the heights at the robot's position and `pos-3-2` match for each placement.

4. **Place Blocks at `pos-3-2`**:
   - Place blocks from adjacent positions when heights match until `pos-3-2` reaches height 4.

**Final Step**:

- **Ensure No Blocks are Carried**:
  - The robot returns to the depot without carrying any blocks, satisfying the final condition.

This plan optimally uses the actions allowed, minimizes unnecessary movements, and addresses the constraints of not being able to place blocks at the depot or the robot's current position, as well as matching heights for block placement.
