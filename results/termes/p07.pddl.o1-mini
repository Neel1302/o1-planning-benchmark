Certainly! Below is an **optimal plan** to achieve the goal of building the height at `pos-0-3` to **3** using the minimal number of actions. This plan ensures that all created blocks are placed appropriately, leaving the robot with no unplaced blocks at the end.

### **Optimal Plan Sequence**

1. **Create Block at Depot**
   - **Action:** `Create a block at the depot.`
   - **Result:** Robot now **has 1 block**.

2. **Create Block at Depot**
   - **Action:** `Create a block at the depot.`
   - **Result:** Robot now **has 2 blocks**.

3. **Create Block at Depot**
   - **Action:** `Create a block at the depot.`
   - **Result:** Robot now **has 3 blocks**.

4. **Move Right to pos-2-1**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-1.`
   - **Result:** Robot is now at **pos-2-1**.

5. **Move Right to pos-2-2**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-2.`
   - **Result:** Robot is now at **pos-2-2**.

6. **Move Up to pos-1-2**
   - **Action:** `Move up to pos-1-2.`
   - **Result:** Robot is now at **pos-1-2**.

7. **Move Up to pos-0-2**
   - **Action:** `Move up to pos-0-2.`
   - **Result:** Robot is now at **pos-0-2**, which is adjacent to **pos-0-3**.

8. **Place Block at pos-0-3 (First Block)**
   - **Action:** `Place a block at pos-0-3.`
   - **Result:** Height at **pos-0-3** becomes **1**. Robot now **has 2 blocks**.

9. **Place Block at pos-0-3 (Second Block)**
   - **Action:** `Place a block at pos-0-3.`
   - **Result:** Height at **pos-0-3** becomes **2**. Robot now **has 1 block**.

10. **Place Block at pos-0-3 (Third Block)**
    - **Action:** `Place a block at pos-0-3.`
    - **Result:** Height at **pos-0-3** becomes **3**. Robot now **has 0 blocks**.

### **Summary of Actions**

1. Create block at depot.
2. Create block at depot.
3. Create block at depot.
4. Move to pos-2-1.
5. Move to pos-2-2.
6. Move up to pos-1-2.
7. Move up to pos-0-2.
8. Place a block at pos-0-3.
9. Place a block at pos-0-3.
10. Place a block at pos-0-3.

### **Explanation**

- **Block Creation:** The robot first creates three blocks at the depot, ensuring it has enough blocks to build the desired height.
  
- **Movement:** The robot navigates from the depot (`pos-2-0`) to the adjacent position (`pos-0-2`) of the target cell (`pos-0-3`). This path minimizes the number of moves required.
  
- **Block Placement:** Once adjacent to `pos-0-3`, the robot places the three blocks sequentially to achieve the required height of 3.

- **Final State:** The robot successfully constructs the desired structure at `pos-0-3` with a height of 3 and has no unplaced blocks remaining, satisfying all problem constraints.

This sequence ensures the **optimal** and **efficient** completion of the task with the **minimum number of actions**.
