Yes, here is an optimal plan to achieve the goal, written as a sequence of actions:

**Goal**: Build up the heights at `pos-2-1` and `pos-3-0` to 3, starting from the initial state where all positions have height 0, the robot is at `pos-2-0` (the depot), and the robot has no block.

**Plan**:

1. **Create Block** at the depot (`pos-2-0`).
2. **Place Block** at `pos-2-1` from `pos-2-0`. (Both positions are at height 0.)
   - Now, `pos-2-1` has height 1.
3. **Create Block** at the depot.
4. **Place Block** at `pos-3-0` from `pos-2-0`. (Both positions are at height 0.)
   - Now, `pos-3-0` has height 1.
5. **Create Block** at the depot.
6. **Move Up** to `pos-2-1` from `pos-2-0`. (Height difference is +1.)
   - Robot is now at `pos-2-1` (height 1) with a block.
7. **Move Down** to `pos-2-2` from `pos-2-1`. (Height difference is -1.)
   - Robot is at `pos-2-2` (height 0) with a block.
8. **Place Block** at `pos-2-1` from `pos-2-2`. (`pos-2-2` and `pos-2-1` are neighboring positions.)
   - Both positions are at height 1 (after placing the block).
   - Now, `pos-2-1` has height 2.
9. **Return to Depot**:
   - **Move Up** to `pos-2-1` from `pos-2-2`. (Height difference is +1.)
   - **Move Down** to `pos-2-0` from `pos-2-1`. (Height difference is -1.)
   - Robot is back at the depot (`pos-2-0`, height 0).
10. **Create Block** at the depot.
11. **Move Up** to `pos-2-1` from `pos-2-0`. (Height difference is +2; cannot move directly.)
    - Instead, **Move Up** to an intermediate position:
      - **Place Block** at `pos-1-0` from the depot to increase its height.
      - **Move Up** to `pos-1-0` (height 1).
      - **Move Down** to `pos-1-1` (height 0).
      - **Move Up** to `pos-2-1` (height 2).
12. **Place Block** at `pos-2-1` from a neighboring position at height 2 (e.g., `pos-2-2` if built up).
    - Now, `pos-2-1` has height 3.
13. **Return to Depot** following permissible moves.
14. **Repeat similar steps to build up `pos-3-0` to height 3**:
    - Create and carry blocks to `pos-3-0`, using neighboring positions to place blocks when heights match.
    - Ensure that the robot's current position's height matches the target position's height when placing blocks.
15. **Ensure that the robot ends without holding a block**.

**Notes**:
- The robot must use neighboring positions to incrementally build up to the required heights, carefully moving up and down according to the movement constraints.
- Since the robot cannot place blocks at its current position or at the depot, it must navigate to appropriate positions to place blocks.
- The robot utilizes intermediate positions and may need to build temporary structures (steps) to achieve the necessary heights for placing blocks at the target positions.
- All actions comply with the rules provided, including movement and placement constraints.

This plan achieves the goal efficiently by strategically creating, moving, and placing blocks while adhering to the robot's operational constraints.
