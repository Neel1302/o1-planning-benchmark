Yes, I can provide an optimal plan to achieve the goal. 

Given the constraints and the robot's capabilities, the optimal plan involves building up the neighboring positions to the same height as the target positions to allow the robot to place blocks at higher levels.

Here's the step-by-step optimal plan:

**Build up `pos-3-0` to height 2:**

1. **At Depot (`pos-2-0`):** Create a block.
2. **Move:** From `pos-2-0` to `pos-3-0` (heights are the same).
3. **Move:** From `pos-3-0` to `pos-3-1` (heights are the same).
4. **Place Block:** At `pos-3-0` from `pos-3-1`. Both `pos-3-1` and `pos-3-0` are at height 0.
   - Now, `pos-3-0` is at height 1.
5. **At `pos-3-1` (Height 0):** Cannot place another block at `pos-3-0` because the heights differ.
6. **Return to Depot:**
   - **Move:** From `pos-3-1` to `pos-3-0` (cannot move because `pos-3-0` is now at height 1 and `pos-3-1` is at height 0).
   - **Solution:** Build up `pos-3-1` to height 1.
7. **At Depot (`pos-2-0`):** Create a block.
8. **Move:** From `pos-2-0` to `pos-3-1` (cannot directly because of height difference).
   - **Intermediate Step:** 
     - **Move:** From `pos-2-0` to `pos-2-1` (heights are the same).
     - **Place Block:** At `pos-3-1` from `pos-2-1` (both at height 0).
       - Now, `pos-3-1` is at height 1.
9. **Move:** From `pos-2-1` back to `pos-2-0`.
10. **At Depot (`pos-2-0`):** Create another block.
11. **Move:** From `pos-2-0` to `pos-2-1` (height 0).
12. **Move Up:** From `pos-2-1` (height 0) to `pos-3-1` (height 1).
13. **Place Block:** At `pos-3-0` from `pos-3-1`. Both positions are now at height 1.
    - Now, `pos-3-0` is at height 2.

**Build up `pos-2-3` to height 4:**

1. **At Depot (`pos-2-0`):** Create a block.
2. **Move:** From `pos-2-0` to `pos-2-1` (height 0).
3. **Move:** From `pos-2-1` to `pos-2-2` (height 0).
4. **Place Block:** At `pos-2-3` from `pos-2-2`. Both at height 0.
   - Now, `pos-2-3` is at height 1.
5. **At `pos-2-2` (height 0):** Build up `pos-2-2` to height 1 to match `pos-2-3` height.
6. **Return to Depot:**
   - **Move:** Back to `pos-2-0` via `pos-2-1`.
7. **At Depot (`pos-2-0`):** Create a block.
8. **Move:** To `pos-2-1` (height 0).
9. **Place Block:** At `pos-2-2` from `pos-2-1` (both at height 0).
   - Now, `pos-2-2` is at height 1.
10. **Move Up:** From `pos-2-1` (height 0) to `pos-2-2` (height 1).
11. **At `pos-2-2` (height 1):** Place block at `pos-2-3` (height 1).
    - Now, `pos-2-3` is at height 2.
12. **Repeat Steps 6-11:** Increase both `pos-2-2` and `pos-2-3` heights to 4 by creating blocks at the depot, moving them to `pos-2-2`, and placing them at `pos-2-3`.

**Ensure the Robot is Not Holding a Block at the End:**

- After building `pos-2-3` to height 4 and `pos-3-0` to height 2, ensure the robot returns to the depot if holding a block and destroys it.

This plan minimizes the number of actions by efficiently building up the heights at both the target positions and the necessary neighboring positions to allow the robot to place blocks at higher levels.
