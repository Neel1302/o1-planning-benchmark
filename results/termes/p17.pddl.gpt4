Sure, I can provide a simple optimal plan that describes the sequence of actions the robot needs to perform in order to build the structure as described: 

1. Create a block at depot pos-3-0.
2. Move to pos-3-1.
3. Move to pos-3-2.
4. Place a block at pos-3-2.
5. Move to pos-3-1.
6. Move to pos-3-0.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 two more times to create a height of 3 at pos-3-2.
8. After creating the third block at depot pos-3-0, move to pos-2-0.
9. Place a block at pos-2-0.
10. Move to pos-3-0.
11. Repeat steps 1, 8-10 two more times to create a height of 3 at pos-2-0.
12. After creating the third block at depot pos-3-0, move to pos-1-0.
13. Place a block at pos-1-0.
14. Move to pos-3-0.
15. Repeat steps 1, 12-14 two more times to create a height of 3 at pos-1-0.
16. After creating the third block at depot pos-3-0, move to pos-1-1.
17. Move to pos-1-2.
18. Place a block at pos-1-2.
19. Move to pos-1-1.
20. Move to pos-3-0.
21. Repeat steps 1-6, 16-20 two more times to create a height of 3 at pos-1-2.
22. After creating the third block at depot pos-3-0, move to pos-0-0.
23. Move to pos-0-1.
24. Place a block at pos-0-1.
25. Move to pos-0-0.
26. Move to pos-3-0.
27. Repeat steps 1-6, 22-26 two more times to create a height of 3 at pos-0-1.

In the end, all the five positions mentioned will have a height of 3 and robot won't have any unplaced blocks.
