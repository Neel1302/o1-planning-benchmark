Yes, here is an optimal plan to achieve the goal:

**Initial State:**
- The robot is at `pos-2-0` (the depot) with no block.
- All positions have a height of 0.
- The depot is at `pos-2-0`.

**Goal:**
- Build up the height at `pos-0-3` to 4.
- The robot must not have an unplaced block at the end.

**Plan:**

1. **Create a block at the depot.**
   - Action: `create_block`
   - The robot now has a block.

2. **Move from `pos-2-0` to `pos-2-1`.**
   - Action: `move`
   - Positions: `pos-2-0` → `pos-2-1`

3. **Move from `pos-2-1` to `pos-2-2`.**
   - Action: `move`
   - Positions: `pos-2-1` → `pos-2-2`

4. **Move from `pos-2-2` to `pos-2-3`.**
   - Action: `move`
   - Positions: `pos-2-2` → `pos-2-3`

- All placements are completed, and the robot does not have an unplaced block.

This plan minimizes the number of actions by efficiently building up both `pos-1-3` and `pos-0-3` to the required heights, using neighboring positions and the allowed actions to move up and down as needed.
