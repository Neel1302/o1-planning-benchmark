Certainly! Below is an optimal step-by-step plan for the robot to achieve the desired block heights on the grid. The plan ensures minimal movements and actions while adhering to all constraints.

### **Grid Layout:**
```
pos-0-0 | pos-0-1 | pos-0-2
--------------------------
pos-1-0 | pos-1-1 | pos-1-2
--------------------------
pos-2-0 | pos-2-1 | pos-2-2
--------------------------
pos-3-0 | pos-3-1 | pos-3-2
```
- **Depot Location:** pos-1-0
- **Robot Starting Position:** pos-1-0
- **Maximum Height:** 5
- **Goals:**
  - pos-1-2: Height 5
  - pos-2-0: Height 2
  - pos-3-1: Height 5
  - pos-3-2: Height 4
- **Constraint:** No unplaced blocks at the end.

### **Action Definitions:**
1. **Create Block at Depot:** Gain a block (only at pos-1-0).
2. **Destroy Block at Depot:** Remove a block (only at pos-1-0; requires holding a block).
3. **Move:** Change position horizontally on the same height.
4. **Move Up:** Move to a position one block higher.
5. **Move Down:** Move to a position one block lower.
6. **Place Block:** Place a block on a neighboring position (requires holding a block).
7. **Remove Block:** Remove a block from a neighboring position (requires not holding a block).

### **Optimal Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Building pos-1-2 to Height 5**
To build pos-1-2 to height 5, we need to increment it step-by-step. Each increment requires the adjacent pos-1-1 to match the current height of pos-1-2.

**For each of the 5 layers:**
1. **Create Block at Depot:**
   - `Create block at pos-1-0`  
2. **Place Block at pos-1-1:**
   - `Place block at pos-1-1`  
   - *(pos-1-1 height increases by 1)*  
3. **Move to pos-1-1:**
   - `Move to pos-1-1`  
4. **Create Block at Depot:**
   - `Move back to pos-1-0`  
   - `Create block at pos-1-0`  
5. **Place Block at pos-1-2:**
   - `Move to pos-1-1`  
   - `Place block at pos-1-2`  
   - *(pos-1-2 height increases by 1)*  
6. **Return to Depot:**
   - `Move back to pos-1-0`  

Repeat these 6 steps five times to achieve pos-1-2 at height 5.

#### **Phase 2: Building pos-2-0 to Height 2**
Building pos-2-0 is straightforward as it's adjacent to the depot.

**For each of the 2 blocks:**
1. **Create Block at Depot:**
   - `Create block at pos-1-0`  
2. **Place Block at pos-2-0:**
   - `Place block at pos-2-0`  
   - *(pos-2-0 height increases by 1)* 

Repeat these 2 steps twice to achieve pos-2-0 at height 2.

#### **Phase 3: Building pos-3-1 to Height 5**
Building pos-3-1 requires incrementing it step-by-step via its neighbor pos-2-1.

**For each of the 5 layers:**
1. **Create Block at Depot:**
   - `Create block at pos-1-0`  
2. **Place Block at pos-2-1:**
   - `Move to pos-2-1`  
   - `Place block at pos-2-1`  
   - *(pos-2-1 height increases by 1)*  
3. **Move to pos-2-1:**
   - *(Already at pos-2-1 after placement)*  
4. **Create Block at Depot:**
   - `Move back to pos-1-0`  
   - `Create block at pos-1-0`  
5. **Place Block at pos-3-1:**
   - `Move to pos-2-1`  
   - `Place block at pos-3-1`  
   - *(pos-3-1 height increases by 1)*  
6. **Return to Depot:**
   - `Move back to pos-1-0`  

Repeat these 6 steps five times to achieve pos-3-1 at height 5.

#### **Phase 4: Building pos-3-2 to Height 4**
Building pos-3-2 requires pos-3-1 to match its current height each time.

**For each of the 4 layers:**
1. **Create Block at Depot:**
   - `Create block at pos-1-0`  
2. **Place Block at pos-3-1:**
   - `Move to pos-3-1`  
   - `Place block at pos-3-1`  
   - *(pos-3-1 height increases by 1)*  
3. **Move to pos-3-1:**
   - *(Already at pos-3-1 after placement)*  
4. **Create Block at Depot:**
   - `Move back to pos-1-0`  
   - `Create block at pos-1-0`  
5. **Place Block at pos-3-2:**
   - `Move to pos-3-1`  
   - `Place block at pos-3-2`  
   - *(pos-3-2 height increases by 1)*  
6. **Return to Depot:**
   - `Move back to pos-1-0`  

Repeat these 6 steps four times to achieve pos-3-2 at height 4.

### **Final Step: Ensure No Unplaced Blocks**
After building all structures:
- The robot is back at the depot.
- No blocks are held by the robot.
- No unplaced blocks remain.

### **Summary of Actions:**
1. **Phase 1:** 5 Iterations × 6 Actions = 30 Actions
2. **Phase 2:** 2 Iterations × 2 Actions = 4 Actions
3. **Phase 3:** 5 Iterations × 6 Actions = 30 Actions
4. **Phase 4:** 4 Iterations × 6 Actions = 24 Actions
5. **Total Actions:** 30 + 4 + 30 + 24 = **88 Actions**

This sequence ensures that all target positions reach their desired heights efficiently while adhering to movement and placement constraints. The robot systematically creates, places, and returns to the depot, ensuring no blocks are left unplaced at the end.
