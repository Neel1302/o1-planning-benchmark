Sure, let's establish the most efficient plan possible.

1. First, we need to create a block at the depot (create-block). 
2. Then, move right to pos-2-1 (move-right 2-0 2-1). 
3. Place a block at pos-2-2 (place-block 2-2). 
4. Move back left to the depot (move-left 2-1 2-0). 
5. Repeat steps 1 through 4 two more times to place two more blocks on top of each other at pos-2-2. (Note: After each block placement, the robot must return to the depot to create a new block for placement.)
6. From the depot, move right three times to pos-2-3 (move-right 2-0 2-1, move-right 2-1 2-2, move-right 2-2 2-3).
7. Move upward to pos-1-3 (move-up 2-3 1-3).
8. Move upward again to pos-0-3 (move-up 1-3 0-3).
9. Remove all three blocks from pos-2-2 and place them one by one at pos-0-3 in the same manner as earlier described (remove-block 2-2, move-block, place-block 0-3, repeat...).
10. With all blocks placed, be sure to either be in possession of a block or return to the depot to destroy it (destroy-block or move-left, move-down, move-down).

This assumes that moving right is as simple as moving from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1 and that moving upward is like moving from pos-2-3 to pos-1-3, etc. This approach reduces the number of excessive movements, making the robot more efficient in completing its task. The robot may need to move between different heights or positions as needed to carry out this procedure.
