To solve this problem optimally, we need to carefully plan a series of actions that comply with the given constraints and efficiently build the stack of blocks at `pos-2-1` to reach a height of 5.

Here is an optimal plan:

1. **Create Block at Depot**: While at `pos-2-0` (the depot) with no block, create a block. The robot now has a block.

2. **Place Block at pos-2-1**: From `pos-2-0`, place the block at the neighboring position `pos-2-1`, which has the same height (both are at height 0). The robot no longer has a block. The height at `pos-2-1` is now 1.

3. **Move Up to pos-2-1**: Move up from `pos-2-0` (height 0) to `pos-2-1` (height 1). The robot is now at `pos-2-1` at height 1.

4. **Move Down to pos-2-2**: Move down from `pos-2-1` (height 1) to `pos-2-2` (height 0). The robot is now at `pos-2-2` at height 0.

5. **Create Block at Depot**: Return to the depot at `pos-2-0`. From `pos-2-2`, move horizontally to `pos-2-0` (both at height 0). At the depot, create a block. The robot now has a block.

6. **Move Up to pos-2-1**: Move up from `pos-2-0` (height 0) to `pos-2-1` (height 1).

7. **Place Block at pos-2-1 from pos-2-1**: While at `pos-2-1` (height 1), attempt to place the block at a neighboring position with the same height. However, since all neighboring positions are at a different height, we cannot place the block directly.

8. **Build Staircase at pos-3-1**: To get higher, we need to build a staircase at `pos-3-1`. Move down from `pos-2-1` (height 1) to `pos-3-1` (height 0). From `pos-3-1`, place the block at `pos-2-1` if the heights match.

9. **Repeat Staircase Construction**: Continue this process, creating blocks at the depot, moving to `pos-3-1`, and building up the height at `pos-3-1` until it's high enough to place the next block at `pos-2-1`. Each time, ensure that the heights match the constraints for placement.

10. **Final Steps**: Once you've built up `pos-3-1` to the necessary height, you can place the remaining blocks at `pos-2-1` to reach the desired height of 5.

This plan carefully navigates the constraints by:

- **Using the Depot Efficiently**: Creating blocks only when necessary and returning to the depot as needed.
- **Building Support Structures**: Constructing a staircase at `pos-3-1` allows the robot to reach higher levels at `pos-2-1`.
- **Matching Heights for Placement**: Ensuring that the robot's current position and the target position for block placement have the same height.

By following this plan, the robot minimizes unnecessary movements and actions, resulting in an optimal solution to the problem.

**Optimal Sequence of Actions:**

1. Create block at `pos-2-0` (robot has block).
2. Place block at `pos-2-1` from `pos-2-0`. (`pos-2-1` height = 1)
3. Move up to `pos-2-1` (height 1).
4. Move down to `pos-3-1` (height 0).
5. Return to depot at `pos-2-0`.
6. Create block at depot (robot has block).
7. Move up to `pos-2-1` (height 1).
8. Move down to `pos-3-1` (height 0).
9. Place block at `pos-3-1` (height at `pos-3-1` = 1).
10. Move up to `pos-3-1` (height 1).
11. From `pos-3-1`, place block at `pos-2-1` (heights match at 1). (`pos-2-1` height = 2)
12. Repeat steps 5-11, building up `pos-3-1` and placing blocks at `pos-2-1` until `pos-2-1` reaches height 5.
13. Ensure the robot ends without holding a block.

This sequence satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal efficiently.
