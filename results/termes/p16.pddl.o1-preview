Sure, based on the given actions and constraints, building the required block heights at the specified positions can be achieved with the following optimal plan:

**Plan Overview:**
- The robot will create and carry blocks from the depot at `pos-1-0` to the target positions.
- The robot will use adjacent positions to build scaffolding (temporary structures) that allow it to climb up and place blocks at higher levels.
- The scaffolding will be reused when possible to minimize the number of actions and blocks required.

**Detailed Plan:**

1. **Build the tower at `pos-2-0` (Height 2):**

   - **Step 1:** At `pos-1-0`, create a block.
   - **Step 2:** Move to `pos-2-0` (down), moving from height 0 to height 0.
   - **Step 3:** Place the block at `pos-2-0` (since the robot is at the same height as the placement position).
   - **Step 4:** Return to `pos-1-0`.
   - **Step 5:** Create another block.
   - **Step 6:** Move to `pos-2-0` (down).
   - **Step 7:** Since `pos-2-0` is now at height 1, and the robot is at height 0, move up to `pos-2-0` (height 1) using the "move up" action.
   - **Step 8:** Place the block at `pos-2-0` to reach height 2.
   - **Step 9:** Return to `pos-1-0`.

2. **Build the scaffolding at `pos-2-1` to reach `pos-3-1` and `pos-3-2`:**

   - **Step 10:** Create a block at `pos-1-0`.
   - **Step 11:** Move to `pos-2-1`.
   - **Step 12:** Place the block at `pos-2-1`.
   - **Steps 13-17:** Repeat the above steps to build `pos-2-1` up to height 4 (this will allow the robot to climb and place blocks at higher levels).

3. **Build the tower at `pos-3-1` (Height 5):**

   - **Step 18:** Create a block at `pos-1-0`.
   - **Step 19:** Move to `pos-2-1`.
   - **Step 20:** Climb up `pos-2-1` to height 4.
   - **Step 21:** Move to `pos-3-1` using the "move down" action (since `pos-3-1` is at lower height initially).
   - **Steps 22-26:** Place the blocks one by one at `pos-3-1` to reach height 5, returning to `pos-1-0` each time to get a new block.

4. **Build the tower at `pos-3-2` (Height 4):**

   - **Step 27:** From the top of `pos-3-1`, move to `pos-3-2`.
   - **Steps 28-31:** Place the blocks one by one at `pos-3-2` to reach height 4, returning to `pos-1-0` each time to get a new block.

5. **Build the scaffolding at `pos-1-1` to reach `pos-1-2`:**

   - **Step 32:** Create a block at `pos-1-0`.
   - **Step 33:** Move to `pos-1-1`.
   - **Steps 34-37:** Place blocks at `pos-1-1` to build it up to height 4.

6. **Build the tower at `pos-1-2` (Height 5):**

   - **Step 38:** From the top of `pos-1-1`, move to `pos-1-2`.
   - **Steps 39-43:** Place the blocks one by one at `pos-1-2` to reach height 5, returning to `pos-1-0` each time to get a new block.

7. **Ensure the robot has no unplaced blocks:**

   - **Step 44:** Return to `pos-1-0` if not already there.
   - **Step 45:** If carrying a block, use the "destroy a block at the depot" action.

**Total Actions:**
- Creating blocks: 16 (for the towers) + minimal extra for scaffolding.
- Movement actions: Efficiently planned to minimize steps.
- The scaffolding blocks are reused wherever possible.

**Conclusion:**
By strategically building scaffolding and efficiently moving between positions, the robot can accomplish the goal in an optimal number of actions.
