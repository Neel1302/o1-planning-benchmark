Certainly! Here's an **optimal sequence of actions** for the robot to achieve the goal of building the height at `pos-2-1` to 5, ensuring no unplaced blocks remain at the end.

### **Action Sequence:**

1. **Create a Block at Depot (`pos-2-0`)**
   - **Effect:** Robot now **has** a block.

2. **Place Block at `pos-2-1`**
   - **Effect:** 
     - `pos-2-1` height increases to **1**.
     - Robot now **does not have** a block.

3. **Create a Block at Depot (`pos-2-0`)**
   - **Effect:** Robot now **has** a block.

4. **Place Block at `pos-2-1`**
   - **Effect:** 
     - `pos-2-1` height increases to **2**.
     - Robot now **does not have** a block.

5. **Create a Block at Depot (`pos-2-0`)**
   - **Effect:** Robot now **has** a block.

6. **Place Block at `pos-2-1`**
   - **Effect:** 
     - `pos-2-1` height increases to **3**.
     - Robot now **does not have** a block.

7. **Create a Block at Depot (`pos-2-0`)**
   - **Effect:** Robot now **has** a block.

8. **Place Block at `pos-2-1`**
   - **Effect:** 
     - `pos-2-1` height increases to **4**.
     - Robot now **does not have** a block.

9. **Create a Block at Depot (`pos-2-0`)**
   - **Effect:** Robot now **has** a block.

10. **Place Block at `pos-2-1`**
    - **Effect:** 
      - `pos-2-1` height increases to **5**.
      - Robot now **does not have** a block.

### **Summary:**

- **Total Actions:** 10 (5 cycles of Create â†’ Place)
- **Final State:**
  - `pos-2-1` has a height of **5**.
  - Robot **does not have** any unplaced blocks.
  - Depot (`pos-2-0`) remains in its initial state with no extra blocks.

This plan ensures that the robot efficiently builds the desired structure with the minimal number of actions while adhering to all constraints.
