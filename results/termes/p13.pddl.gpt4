Here's a sequence of actions that should achieve the stated goal:

1. Create a block at the depot.
2. Move to pos-2-1.
3. Move to pos-2-2.
4. Place the block at pos-2-2. (pos-2-2 height = 1)
5. Move to pos-2-1.
6. Move to pos-2-0 (Depot).
7. Repeat steps 1-6 three more times. (After these, pos-2-2 height = 4)

8. Create a block at the depot.
9. Move to pos-2-1.
10. Move to pos-1-1.
11. Move to pos-0-1.
12. Place the block at pos-0-1. (pos-0-1 height = 1)
13. Move to pos-1-1.
14. Move to pos-2-1.
15. Move to pos-2-0 (Depot).
16. Repeat steps 8-15 two more times.  (After these, pos-0-1 height = 3)

17. Create a block at the depot.
18. Move to pos-3-0.
19. Place the block at pos-3-0. (pos-3-0 height = 1)
20. Move to pos-2-0 (Depot).
21. Repeat steps 17-20 two more times. (After these, pos-3-0 height = 3)  

At the end of these steps, each goal has been achieved in 40 steps.

It's worth noting that this is just one of potentially many correct solutions, and the order of the steps could be changed in a variety of ways without altering the final result.
