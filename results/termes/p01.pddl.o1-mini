Yes, I can provide an optimal sequence of actions to achieve the goal of building a height of 3 at `pos-1-2`. The plan involves creating and placing three blocks, one at a time, while ensuring that the robot adheres to all the constraints specified.

### **Optimal Plan Overview**

1. **Initialize and Create Blocks:**
   - For each block, the robot will create the block at the depot (`pos-2-0`).

2. **Navigate to Placement Position:**
   - Move from the depot to adjacent positions near `pos-1-2` to place the block.

3. **Place the Block:**
   - Place the block at `pos-1-2`, incrementing its height by one each time.

4. **Return to Depot:**
   - After placing each block, return to the depot to create the next block.

### **Detailed Sequence of Actions**

The sequence below outlines the step-by-step actions for building three blocks at `pos-1-2`, achieving a final height of 3.

#### **Block 1: Building Height 1 at pos-1-2**

1. **Create a Block at Depot**
   - **Action:** `Create a block at pos-2-0.`
   - **Result:** Robot now **has** one block.

2. **Move to pos-2-1**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-1 (East from pos-2-0).`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-2-1` at height 0.

3. **Move to pos-1-1**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-1-1 (North from pos-2-1).`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-1-1` at height 0.

4. **Place Block at pos-1-2**
   - **Action:** `Place a block at pos-1-2 from pos-1-1.`
   - **Result:** 
     - `pos-1-2` height increases to **1**.
     - Robot **no longer** has a block.

5. **Return to Depot**
   - **Action:** 
     - `Move back to pos-1-1 (South from pos-1-1 to pos-2-1).`
     - `Move back to pos-2-0 (West from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0).`
   - **Result:** Robot is back at the depot, ready for the next block.

#### **Block 2: Building Height 2 at pos-1-2**

6. **Create a Block at Depot**
   - **Action:** `Create a block at pos-2-0.`
   - **Result:** Robot now **has** one block.

7. **Move to pos-2-1**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-1 (East from pos-2-0).`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-2-1` at height 0.

8. **Move to pos-1-1**
   - **Action:** `Move to pos-1-1 (North from pos-2-1).`
   - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-1-1` at height 0.

9. **Move Up to Height 1**
   - **Action:** `Move up from pos-1-1 to height 1.`
   - **Result:** 
     - Robot is at `pos-1-1` at height **1**.
     - This aligns with the current height of `pos-1-2` (which is 1).

10. **Place Block at pos-1-2**
    - **Action:** `Place a block at pos-1-2 from pos-1-1.`
    - **Result:** 
      - `pos-1-2` height increases to **2**.
      - Robot **no longer** has a block.

11. **Move Down to Height 0**
    - **Action:** `Move down from pos-1-1 to height 0.`
    - **Result:** 
      - Robot is at `pos-1-1` at height **0**.

12. **Return to Depot**
    - **Action:** 
      - `Move back to pos-2-1 (South from pos-1-1 to pos-2-1).`
      - `Move back to pos-2-0 (West from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0).`
    - **Result:** Robot is back at the depot, ready for the next block.

#### **Block 3: Building Height 3 at pos-1-2**

13. **Create a Block at Depot**
    - **Action:** `Create a block at pos-2-0.`
    - **Result:** Robot now **has** one block.

14. **Move to pos-2-1**
    - **Action:** `Move to pos-2-1 (East from pos-2-0).`
    - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-2-1` at height 0.

15. **Move to pos-1-1**
    - **Action:** `Move to pos-1-1 (North from pos-2-1).`
    - **Result:** Robot is at `pos-1-1` at height 0.

16. **Move Up to Height 2**
    - **Action:** `Move up from pos-1-1 to height 1, then to height 2.`
    - **Result:** 
      - Robot is at `pos-1-1` at height **2**.
      - This aligns with the current height of `pos-1-2` (which is 2).

17. **Place Block at pos-1-2**
    - **Action:** `Place a block at pos-1-2 from pos-1-1.`
    - **Result:** 
      - `pos-1-2` height increases to **3**.
      - Robot **no longer** has a block.

18. **Move Down to Height 0**
    - **Action:** 
      - `Move down from pos-1-1 to height 1, then to height 0.`
    - **Result:** 
      - Robot is at `pos-1-1` at height **0**.
