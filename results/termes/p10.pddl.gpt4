Here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

Step 1: Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0). 
Step 2: Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1.
Step 3: Place a block at pos-2-2.
Step 4: Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0.
Step 5: Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
Step 6: Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-2.
Step 7: Place a block at pos-2-3.
Step 8: Move from pos-2-2 to pos-2-0.
Step 9: Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
Step 10: Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-3.
Step 11: Place a block at pos-2-3.
Step 12: Move from pos-2-3 to pos-2-0.
Step 13: Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
Step 14: Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-3.
Step 15: Place a block at pos-2-3.
Step 16: Move from pos-2-3 to pos-2-0.
Step 17: Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
Step 18: Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
Step 19: Place a block at pos-3-0.
Step 20: Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0.
Step 21: Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
Step 22: Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
Step 23: Place a block at pos-3-0.

This plan would allow the robot to achieve the desired height of blocks at positions pos-2-3 and pos-3-0 while also ensuring that the robot doesn't have any unplaced block at the end.
