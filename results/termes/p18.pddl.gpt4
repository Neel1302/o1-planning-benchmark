While the problem does not give a specific definition of "optimal", let's assume an optimal plan in this scenario means a plan that uses the fewest steps.

The final structure should look like this:

```
2 0 2
3 0 3
0 0 2
0 2 0
```

Here is an optimal plan (each step starts with the robot at the depot and ends with it at the depot):

1. Create a block at the depot.
2. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-0.
3. Place the block at pos-1-0.
4. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-2-0.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 two more times.
6. Create a block at the depot.
7. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1 then to pos-1-1 and finally to pos-1-2.
8. Place the block at pos-1-2.
9. Move from pos-1-2 to pos-1-1 then to pos-2-1 and finally to pos-2-0. 
10. Repeat steps 6-9 two more times.
11. Create a block at the depot.
12. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
13. Place the block at pos-3-0.
14. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0.
15. Repeat steps 11-14.
16. Create a block at the depot.
17. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1.
18. Place the block at pos-2-1.
19. Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0.
20. Repeat steps 16-19.
21. Create a block at the depot.
22. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0 then to pos-3-1.
23. Place the block at pos-3-1.
24. Move from pos-3-1 to pos-3-0 then to pos-2-0.
25. Repeat steps 21-24.
26. Create a block at the depot.
27. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-2.
28. Place the block at pos-2-2.
29. Move from pos-2-2 to pos-2-0.
30. Repeat steps 26-29.
31. Create a block at the depot.
32. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-0-0.
33. Place the block at pos-0-0.
34. Move from pos-0-0 to pos-2-0.
35. Repeat steps 31-34.
36. Create a block at the depot.
37. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-0-2.
38. Place the block at pos-0-2.
39. Move from pos-0-2 to pos-2-0.
40. Repeat steps 36-39.

At the end of this sequence, the desired structure is built, and the robot doesn't have any blocks left (as it should be).
