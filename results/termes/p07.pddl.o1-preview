Certainly! Here is an optimal plan to achieve the goal, step by step:

**Initial Setup:**
- The robot starts at the depot position `pos-2-0`.
- All positions have an initial height of 0.
- The goal is to build up the height at `pos-0-3` to 3.

**Plan:**

**First Trip: Place the First Block at `pos-0-3`**

1. **Create a Block at Depot**
   - Action: `CreateBlockAtDepot`
   - The robot now has a block.

2. **Move from `pos-2-0` to `pos-1-0`**
   - Action: `Move(pos-2-0, pos-1-0)`
   - Both positions have height 0.

3. **Move from `pos-1-0` to `pos-0-0`**
   - Action: `Move(pos-1-0, pos-0-0)`

4. **Move from `pos-0-0` to `pos-0-1`**
   - Action: `Move(pos-0-0, pos-0-1)`

5. **Move from `pos-0-1` to `pos-0-2`**
   - Action: `Move(pos-0-1, pos-0-2)`

6. **Place Block at `pos-0-3` from `pos-0-2`**
   - Action: `PlaceBlock(pos-0-2, pos-0-3)`
   - The heights at `pos-0-2` and `pos-0-3` are both 0.
   - `pos-0-3` height becomes 1.
   - The robot no longer has a block.

**Second Trip: Build Up Height at `pos-0-2`**

7. **Return to Depot via Reverse Path**
   - Move back to `pos-2-0`:
     - `Move(pos-0-2, pos-0-1)`
     - `Move(pos-0-1, pos-0-0)`
     - `Move(pos-0-0, pos-1-0)`
     - `Move(pos-1-0, pos-2-0)`

8. **Create a Block at Depot**
   - Action: `CreateBlockAtDepot`
   - The robot now has a block.

9. **Move to `pos-0-1`**
   - Move along the path:
     - `Move(pos-2-0, pos-1-0)`
     - `Move(pos-1-0, pos-0-0)`
     - `Move(pos-0-0, pos-0-1)`

10. **Place Block at `pos-0-2` from `pos-0-1`**
    - Action: `PlaceBlock(pos-0-1, pos-0-2)`
    - Heights at `pos-0-1` and `pos-0-2` are both 0.
    - `pos-0-2` height becomes 1.
    - The robot no longer has a block.

**Third Trip: Place the Second Block at `pos-0-3`**

11. **Return to Depot**
    - Move back to `pos-2-0`:
      - `Move(pos-0-1, pos-0-0)`
      - `Move(pos-0-0, pos-1-0)`
      - `Move(pos-1-0, pos-2-0)`

12. **Create a Block at Depot**
    - Action: `CreateBlockAtDepot`
    - The robot now has a block.

13. **Move to `pos-0-2`**
    - Move along the path:
      - `Move(pos-2-0, pos-1-0)`
      - `Move(pos-1-0, pos-0-0)`
      - `Move(pos-0-0, pos-0-1)`
      - `Move(pos-0-1, pos-0-2)`
    - Note that `pos-0-2` now has height 1.

14. **Move Up to `pos-0-2` (height 1)**
    - Action: `MoveUp(pos-0-1, pos-0-2)`
    - The robot moves from height 0 to height 1.

15. **Place Block at `pos-0-3` from `pos-0-2`**
    - Action: `PlaceBlock(pos-0-2, pos-0-3)`
    - Heights at `pos-0-2` and `pos-0-3` are both 1.
    - `pos-0-3` height becomes 2.
    - The robot no longer has a block.

**Fourth Trip: Increase Height at `pos-0-2`**

16. **Return to Depot**
    - Move back to `pos-2-0`:
      - `MoveDown(pos-0-2, pos-0-1)`
      - `Move(pos-0-1, pos-0-0)`
      - `Move(pos-0-0, pos-1-0)`
      - `Move(pos-1-0, pos-2-0)`

17. **Create a Block at Depot**
    - Action: `CreateBlockAtDepot`
    - The robot now has a block.

18. **Move to `pos-0-1`**
    - Move along the path:
      - `Move(pos-2-0, pos-1-0)`
      - `Move(pos-1-0, pos-0-0)`
      - `Move(pos-0-0, pos-0-1)`

19. **Place Block at `pos-0-2` from `pos-0-1`**
    - Action: `PlaceBlock(pos-0-1, pos-0-2)`
    - Heights at `pos-0-1` and `pos-0-2` are both 1.
    - `pos-0-2` height becomes 2.
    - The robot no longer has a block.

**Fifth Trip: Place the Final Block at `pos-0-3`**

20. **Return to Depot**
    - Move back to `pos-2-0`:
      - `MoveDown(pos-0-1, pos-0-0)`
      - `Move(pos-0-0, pos-1-0)`
      - `Move(pos-1-0, pos-2-0)`

21. **Create a Block at Depot**
    - Action: `CreateBlockAtDepot`
    - The robot now has a block.

22. **Move to `pos-0-2`**
    - Move along the path:
      - `Move(pos-2-0, pos-1-0)`
      - `Move(pos-1-0, pos-0-0)`
      - `Move(pos-0-0, pos-0-1)`
      - `MoveUp(pos-0-1, pos-0-2)` (now at height 2)

23. **Place Block at `pos-0-3` from `pos-0-2`**
    - Action: `PlaceBlock(pos-0-2, pos-0-3)`
    - Heights at `pos-0-2` and `pos-0-3` are both 2.
    - `pos-0-3` height becomes 3.
    - The robot no longer has a block.

**Completion:**

- The robot does not have any block (as required).
- The height at `pos-0-3` is now 3.
- All actions were performed optimally, adjusting adjacent heights as needed to comply with the placement rules.

**Summary of Actions:**

- **Total Actions:** 23 (including creates, moves, places)
- **Strategy:** Incrementally build up the heights at adjacent positions (`pos-0-2`) to match the increasing height at `pos-0-3`, allowing block placement according to the height-matching rule.

This plan ensures that the robot efficiently builds up the required height at `pos-0-3`, complies with all movement and placement rules, and ends without holding any blocks.
