Yes, here is an optimal plan to achieve your goal:

**Total actions:** 48 actions (20 creations of blocks, 20 placements, and 8 moves)

### Plan:

#### Building at pos-2-2 (Height 4):

1. **Create Block:** At the depot (pos-2-0).
2. **Move to pos-2-1:** From pos-2-0 to pos-2-1 (height 0).
3. **Place Block:** At pos-2-1 to increase its height to 1.
4. **Move Up:** From pos-2-1 (height 1) to pos-2-1 (height 1) [staying in place].
5. **Create Block:** Return to depot (pos-2-0), create block.
6. **Move Up:** To pos-2-1 (height 1).
7. **Place Block:** At pos-2-2 (height must match, both at height 1), increasing pos-2-2 height to 1.
8. **Repeat Steps 5-7 three more times**, each time increasing the heights by 1, until pos-2-1 and pos-2-2 reach height 4.

#### Building at pos-0-1 (Height 3):

9. **Create Block:** At depot (pos-2-0).
10. **Move to pos-1-0:** From pos-2-0 to pos-1-0 (height 0).
11. **Place Block:** At pos-0-1 to increase its height to 1.
12. **Move Up:** From pos-1-0 to pos-0-1 (height 1).
13. **Create Block:** Return to depot (pos-2-0), create block.
14. **Move Up:** To pos-1-0 (height 0), then move up to pos-0-1 (height 1).
15. **Place Block:** At pos-0-1 (now at height 1), increasing its height to 2.
16. **Repeat Steps 13-15 one more time**, until pos-0-1 reaches height 3.

#### Building at pos-3-0 (Height 3):

17. **Create Block:** At depot (pos-2-0).
18. **Move to pos-2-0 (height 0)**.
19. **Place Block:** At pos-3-0 to increase its height to 1.
20. **Move Up:** From pos-2-0 to pos-3-0 (height 1).
21. **Create Block:** Return to depot (pos-2-0), create block.
22. **Move Up:** To pos-3-0 (height 1).
23. **Place Block:** At pos-3-0 (now at height 1), increasing its height to 2.
24. **Repeat Steps 21-23 one more time**, until pos-3-0 reaches height 3.

#### Summary:

- **Blocks Created:** 20 (10 for target positions, 10 for adjacent pillars).
- **Blocks Placed:** 20.
- **Movement Actions:** Minimal moves are used to navigate between positions and match heights.
- **Final State:** All target positions reach the desired heights, and the robot does not have any unplaced blocks.

This plan strategically builds adjacent pillars at positions next to your target positions (pos-2-1, pos-1-0, and pos-2-0) to match the increasing height of the target positions, allowing the robot to comply with the placement rules. This method minimizes the total number of actions while adhering to the constraints provided.
