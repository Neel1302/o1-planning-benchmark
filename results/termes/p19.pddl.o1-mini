Certainly! Below is an optimal step-by-step plan to achieve the desired block heights on the grid. This plan ensures minimal movements and actions while adhering to all constraints.

### **Overview:**
- **Depot Location:** pos-3-0
- **Robot Start Position:** pos-3-0
- **Target Heights:**
  - pos-1-0: 4
  - pos-1-1: 4
  - pos-1-2: 2
  - pos-2-0: 2
  - pos-2-2: 2
- **Total Blocks Needed:** 14
- **Constraints:**
  - Maximum height per position: 4
  - No unplaced blocks at the end
  - Depot cannot have blocks placed directly

### **Assumptions:**
- The robot can carry **only one block** at a time.
- All positions not listed in the target have an initial height of **0**.
- The robot must create blocks at the depot before placing them elsewhere.

### **Action Definitions:**
1. **Create:** Generate a block at the depot (robot acquires a block).
2. **Place(pos):** Place the carried block at the specified neighboring position `pos`.
3. **Move(direction):** Move the robot in the specified direction (up, down, left, right).

### **Step-by-Step Plan:**

#### **Phase 1: Building Base Levels (Height 1)**
1. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
2. **Place** the block at **pos-2-0**. *(pos-2-0: 1)*
3. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
4. **Place** the block at **pos-1-0**. *(pos-1-0: 1)*
5. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
6. **Place** the block at **pos-1-1**. *(pos-1-1: 1)*
7. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
8. **Place** the block at **pos-2-2**. *(pos-2-2: 1)*
9. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
10. **Place** the block at **pos-1-2**. *(pos-1-2: 1)*

*At this point:*
- pos-1-0: 1
- pos-1-1: 1
- pos-1-2: 1
- pos-2-0: 1
- pos-2-2: 1

#### **Phase 2: Building Second Levels (Height 2)**
11. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
12. **Place** the block at **pos-2-0**. *(pos-2-0: 2)*
13. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
14. **Place** the block at **pos-1-0**. *(pos-1-0: 2)*
15. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
16. **Place** the block at **pos-1-1**. *(pos-1-1: 2)*
17. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
18. **Place** the block at **pos-2-2**. *(pos-2-2: 2)*
19. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
20. **Place** the block at **pos-1-2**. *(pos-1-2: 2)*

*Now:*
- pos-1-0: 2
- pos-1-1: 2
- pos-1-2: 2
- pos-2-0: 2
- pos-2-2: 2

#### **Phase 3: Building Higher Levels (Height 3 & 4)**
21. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
22. **Place** the block at **pos-1-0**. *(pos-1-0: 3)*
23. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
24. **Place** the block at **pos-1-1**. *(pos-1-1: 3)*
25. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
26. **Place** the block at **pos-1-0**. *(pos-1-0: 4)*
27. **Create** a block at **depot (pos-3-0)**.
28. **Place** the block at **pos-1-1**. *(pos-1-1: 4)*

*Final Heights:*
- pos-1-0: 4
- pos-1-1: 4
- pos-1-2: 2
- pos-2-0: 2
- pos-2-2: 2

#### **Phase 4: Finalizing**
29. **Ensure** the robot is at the **depot (pos-3-0)**.
30. **Destroy** any extra blocks at the depot if the robot is carrying one (ensures no unplaced blocks).

### **Summary of Actions:**
- **Total Create Actions:** 14
- **Total Place Actions:** 14
- **Total Movement Actions:** Minimal, primarily staying at the depot for creation and placing to adjacent positions.

### **Notes for Efficiency:**
- **Batch Actions:** When possible, perform consecutive create and place actions without unnecessary movements.
- **Optimize Path:** Since all target positions are adjacent to the depot, the robot minimizes movement by repeatedly placing blocks from the depot without moving to other positions.

### **Final State Verification:**
- All target positions have reached their specified heights.
- The robot has no blocks remaining in its inventory.
- No unplaced blocks exist in the depot.

This plan ensures that the robot efficiently builds the desired structure with the minimal number of actions and movements required.
